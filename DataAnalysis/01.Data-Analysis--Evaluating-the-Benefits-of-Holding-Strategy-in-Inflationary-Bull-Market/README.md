In general, NVIDIA is a high-tech stock with large intraday price fluctuations. In such a market environment, many strategies may not function effectively, and investors need to choose strategies more carefully.

The reason these indicators were effective is that they can effectively capture medium-to-long term stock price trends and the speed of price changes, thus not missing out on bull stocks or a bull market.

The reason these indicators may become dysfunctional is due to delayed judgments or false signals. As a result, they can lead to frequent buying and selling, and you may miss the best trading opportunities. Especially for stocks with large intraday price fluctuations or during periods when the trend is unclear, the disadvantages of these indicators become more prominent.

In an inflation bull market, if there are significant positive factors in the basic conditions of the trade, such as changes in international political situations, adjustments in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, ETF approvals, semiconductor export restrictions, or an AI-led productivity revolution, using a medium-to-long term quarterly buying and selling strategy could be more efficient and potentially more profitable. Meanwhile, short-term traders can increase their profits by adopting a strategy combining CCI and MACD.
