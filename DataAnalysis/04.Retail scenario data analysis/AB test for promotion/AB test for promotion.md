#### I. Overview of AB Testing
AB testing is an experimental method used to compare two versions (A and B), and it is commonly used to evaluate the effects of different strategies, designs, or functions in products or services. In the fields of business and data analysis, it is widely applied to assess performance differences of various marketing activities, website interfaces, product features, etc., in order to determine which version is superior. Its core idea is to randomly divide users into two or more groups, and each group receives different treatments (e.g., different web page designs, different promotional strategies, etc.). Then, by collecting and analyzing user behavior data and comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) among different groups, it can be determined which treatment is more effective.

#### II. Determination of Minimum Sample Size (Question 2)
- Baseline KPI: In this example, the baseline KPI is 42%, which might be the measured value of the key performance indicator of the existing strategy or control group in use. For instance, it could be the conversion rate of an existing promotional activity, the click-through rate of an existing web page, etc.
- Minimum Effect Magnitude: The expected minimum effect magnitude is 2.5%, which represents the minimum detectable effect difference that the new strategy or treatment is expected to produce. The determination of the minimum sample size aims to ensure that the experiment has sufficient statistical power to detect this effect difference.
- Calculation of Minimum Sample Size: The calculated minimum sample size is 6131 samples. The purpose of determining the minimum sample size is to ensure that the experimental results have sufficient reliability and statistical significance, avoiding misjudgments due to a too-small sample size. The calculation of the sample size usually involves statistical formulas and takes into account factors such as baseline KPI, expected effect magnitude, significance level (typically 5%), and statistical power (usually 80% or 90%).

#### III. Sample Size and Significance Judgment (Question 3)
- Testing with Strictly Minimum Sample Size:
  - When testing with the minimum sample size (6131 samples), if the observed effect is 2.4%, which is lower than the minimum effect magnitude (2.5%), the test result does not have statistical significance. This is because, with a fixed sample size, the effect does not reach the expected minimum detectable difference. It could be due to the limitation of the sample size, making it unable to detect actual but small differences, or it might be that the new strategy indeed has no significant effect.

#### IV. Sample Size Adjustment and Significance Judgment (Question 4)
- Testing with Sample Size Exceeding the Minimum:
  - When testing with 8000 samples (exceeding the minimum sample size), even if the observed effect is 2.4% (lower than the minimum effect magnitude), the result may still have statistical significance.
  - This is because increasing the sample size can enhance statistical power, making the experiment more likely to detect smaller effect differences. After recalculation, when the effect is 2.4%, the minimum sample size increases to 6652, and since 8000 samples are actually used, it indicates that the sample size is sufficient, and the result may be significant. In this case, the actual sample size provides more data, reduces sampling error, and may more accurately reflect the real effect difference, enabling smaller effect differences to be detected.

#### V. Relationship between Minimum Sample Size and Significance Testing (Question 5)
- When Minimum Sample Size is Reached:
  - If the minimum sample size is reached and the observed effect is greater than or equal to the expected minimum value, the result can be considered significant, and there is no need to conduct significance testing again. This is because, in this situation, the experiment already has sufficient capability to detect the expected effect difference, and the actual effect reaches or exceeds the expectation, indicating that the new strategy likely has a significant advantage.
  - However, if the minimum sample size is reached but the actual effect is smaller than the expected minimum value, significance testing needs to be conducted again based on the actual sample size. This is because although the minimum sample size is reached, due to insufficient sample size or other factors, it is impossible to determine whether the result is caused by chance, and further verification of the result's reliability is required.

#### VI. Summary
AB testing is a powerful experimental tool. By scientifically designing experiments and determining sample sizes, it can help decision-makers evaluate the effects of different strategies. The calculation of the minimum sample size is an important step in ensuring the validity of the experiment, but it is not the only basis for judgment. Both the sample size and the actually observed effect will affect the statistical significance of the result. In practical operations, various factors of the experiment need to be considered comprehensively, including sample size, observed effect, and the interpretation and application of results, in order to make reasonable decisions.

- Question	Description of the Situation	Significance Judgment

| Question	| Description of the Situation	| Significance Judgment| 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2	| Minimum sample size is 6131, and the effect is 2.4%	| Not significant because the minimum effect magnitude of 2.5% is not reached| 
| 3	| Sample size is 8000, and the effect is 2.4%	| Significant. After recalculation, the minimum sample size is 6652, and the actual sample size is sufficient| 
| 4	| Minimum sample size is reached and the effect â‰¥ 2.5%	| Significant, no need for re-testing| 
| 5	| Minimum sample size is reached but the effect < 2.5%	| Re-testing is required based on the actual sample size| 


In this way, AB testing can help enterprises and analysts make more informed data-driven decisions in different decision-making scenarios, avoid blindly implementing new strategies, and improve resource utilization efficiency and the scientific nature of decision-making.
