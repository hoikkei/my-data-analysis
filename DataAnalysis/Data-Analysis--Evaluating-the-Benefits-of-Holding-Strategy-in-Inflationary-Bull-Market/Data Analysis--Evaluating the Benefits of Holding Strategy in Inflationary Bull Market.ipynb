    "- ### This table demonstrates that different trading strategies for the same stock (NVIDIA) over the same period can yield completely different results.\n",
    "- ### Let's analyze these trading strategies:\n",
    "From January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024, NVIDIA's stock price increased by approximately 507.98%. During this period, with the support of policy and the development of the AI industry, NVIDIA's stock price was generally in an upward trend. However, as can be seen from the 'NVDA Daily Stock Price Trend and Daily Price Change Percentage' chart, there was no noticeable increase in the stock price from June to October 2023. On the other hand, in other periods, especially after December 2023, the stock price increase was more significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fluctuations in this stock price could be related to the release of AI models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini. GPT-3.5 is an improved version of GPT-3 and was released on August 22, 2023. GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023. Google's Gemini, a large-scale language model, was released on December 6, 2023. The release of these models increased the demand in the AI market, which is believed to have led to NVIDIA's stock price rise in November 2023, especially the sharp rise in January 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, from the 'NVDA Daily Stock Price Trend and Daily Price Change Percentage' chart, it can be seen that NVIDIA's stocks are tech stocks with high volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Analysis of NVIDIA's stock trading strategies will be provided in the next message\n",
    "- 1.Quarterly first buy, quarter-end sell strategy: This strategy yielded a return of 523.73%, which was higher than simply holding on to the stocks. This suggests that regular news, such as quarterly results and product releases, had an impact on the stock price.\n",
    "- 2.Month-start buy, month-end sell strategy: This strategy yielded a return of 403.07%, ranking second among all strategies. With a relatively low number of transactions (15), it allows you to not miss the opportunity when investing in strong stocks in a bull market.\n",
    "- 3.EMA indicator strategy: This strategy yielded a return of 368.39%, ranking third. Although the number of transactions is low (7), the EMA reflects the medium-to-long term trend of the stock price, allowing you to capture larger price fluctuations and achieve high returns.\n",
    "- 4.BOP indicator strategy: Despite having the most transactions (157), the return was 313.67%, ranking fourth. This shows that the BOP indicator has a certain effectiveness in predicting the direction of stock price fluctuations. BOP (Balance Oscillator) is a price-based indicator used to assess the overall momentum of buying and selling. A positive value indicates overselling, and a negative value indicates overbuying.\n",
    "- 5.ADX, MACD strategy: These strategies have a relatively low number of transactions, but the returns are high, at 234.38% and 215.93% respectively. This shows that these two indicators can effectively capture changes in price trends, help discover new trends and determine whether the current trend has ended.\n",
    "- 6.MOM, CCI indicator strategy: The MOM indicator can intuitively represent the momentum of the market, making it easier to capture trends by capturing the speed of price changes. The CCI indicator can judge the over-selling state of the market and turning points by showing how far the stock price deviates from the average price. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### The reason these indicators were effective is that they can effectively capture medium-to-long term stock price trends and the speed of price changes, thus not missing out on bull stocks or a bull market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 7.Turtle strategy, KDJ strategy, RSI strategy, ADOSC strategy, Bollinger Band strategy: During this period, these strategies could not make good predictions for NVIDIA stocks, and the returns were negative. Some have even hit minus 100%. The reasons are as follows:\n",
    "- The turtle strategy can lose effectiveness when the stock price trend is unclear or changes direction frequently. This leads to frequent buying and selling, increasing trading costs.\n",
    "- The Bollinger Band strategy is based on market volatility. When the stock price volatility suddenly increases, the band widens excessively, and it can no longer provide traders with effective signals.\n",
    "- KDJ strategy and RSI strategy are overbought and oversold indicators, and are only effective when the market is in a state of overbuying or overselling. However, when the stock price rises or falls sharply, the market is always considered to be in a state of overbuying or overselling, and these indicators become invalid.\n",
    "- The ADOSC strategy is based on the Accumulation/Distribution Line, which is effective when the stock price rises but becomes invalid when it falls. The main reason these strategies did not work is that they simply followed the indicators without understanding the nature of the market or the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, NVIDIA is a high-tech stock with large intraday price fluctuations, so you need to consider this high volatility when choosing a trading strategy. Moreover, from June to October 2023, the rise in NVIDIA's stock price was not prominent, and the market was sideways. In such a market environment, many strategies may not function effectively, and investors need to choose strategies more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there is no clear trend in the stock price, or the trend changes direction frequently, the Turtle strategy may become ineffective. This strategy can lead to frequent buying and selling, and there is a risk of increased transaction costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, indicators such as KDJ, RSI, and ADOSC may become ineffective when market volatility increases. These indicators have a time delay, the timing to predict market changes may be delayed, and you may miss the best trading opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### The reason these indicators may become dysfunctional is due to delayed judgments or false signals. As a result, they can lead to frequent buying and selling, and you may miss the best trading opportunities. Especially for stocks with large intraday price fluctuations or during periods when the trend is unclear, the disadvantages of these indicators become more prominent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Part 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### The top eight strategies have a common point. They were able to capture the medium-to-long term trend in stock prices and effectively capture changes in the speed of price changes. As a result, they were able to effectively capture the characteristics of bull stocks that make large price moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### On the other hand, the bottom five strategies have a common characteristic. When there is no clear trend in the market, or the trend changes frequently, that is, when the market swings up and down, the indicators may delay judgments or give false signals, leading to frequent buying and selling and missing the best trading opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Particularly for stocks with large intraday price fluctuations or when the trend is unclear, the disadvantages of these indicators stand out.\n",

    "#### For bull stocks like NVIDIA, the return of the quarterly buying and selling strategy exceeded that of the monthly buying and selling strategy. This indicates that in a bull market, it takes some time for a trend to form, and trading over a longer period can potentially yield higher returns. In other words, if you try to capture all market fluctuations in a short period of one month, you may miss important trend changes, potentially reducing your investment returns. Therefore, for bull stocks where the long-term trend is clear, a quarterly buying and selling strategy may be more effective than a monthly buying and selling strategy."

    "The double moving average strategy is not as effective in a bull market as the strategy of buying at the beginning of the month and selling at the end of the month. The reasons are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Trend: In a long-term rising market, a strategy of buying at the beginning of each month and selling at the end of the month may show good performance. This is because you always hold stocks and can benefit from the overall rise in the market. On the other hand, with the double moving average strategy, you may end up selling stocks when the market fluctuates, potentially missing out on some opportunities for increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delay in Trading Signals: A major drawback of the double moving average strategy is that it can be delayed. When the market trend changes, there is a time lag before the trading signal appears. With the double moving average strategy, there is a possibility of more trading signals occurring, which means an increase in trading frequency. As a result, there is a risk of missing important buying and selling timings."

    "- ## Single Stock Trading Strategy 4: Bollinger Bands Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands consist of three lines, with the top and bottom two lines representing the resistance and support lines for the price, respectively. The middle line represents the moving average of the price. The formulas are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle Line = 20-day Moving AverageUpper Line = 20-day Moving Average + N Standard Deviations of 20-day TerminalLower Line = 20-day Moving Average - N Standard Deviations of 20-day Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands Strategy: If the price breaks through the resistance line, sell all, and if it falls below the support line, buy all. One of the challenges in the study of the Bollinger Bands strategy is the choice of the value of N and the setting of the band width. \n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is based on the premise that when the price exceeds the upper and lower bands, it tends to return to the average. However, this premise may not always hold true. Under certain market conditions such as a trending market or a sideways market, the effectiveness of this strategy may vary greatly."

    "The Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA) strategy is mainly used to identify trends, rebounds, and potential support and resistance lines.\n",
    "Like other moving average strategies, consider a buy order when the indicator is upwards and a sell order when it is downwards. In this strategy, you first calculate the TEMA, and generate buying and selling signals based on its changes. If the TEMA is rising, you place a buy order, and if it is falling, you place a sell order. Finally, calculate the daily returns and cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, TEMA has the potential to overly smooth price data, especially when dealing with high volatility tech stocks. This smoothing can result in delayed or distorted signals. This is because TEMA may mistakenly recognize short-term price fluctuations as part of the trend, and it may not effectively filter out noise."
