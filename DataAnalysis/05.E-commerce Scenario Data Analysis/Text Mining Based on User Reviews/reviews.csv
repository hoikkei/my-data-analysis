I like that the strings are different colors, but it cannot be satisfactorily tuned. I spent a long time tuning it yesterday to prepare for his first lesson, only to discover that even without anyone playing it, it had to be completely retuned today before his lesson. Fortunately I can afford to buy a nicer quality item if my child likes his lessons and wants to continue after the first few, but I can't recommend this product.

I mean, it's $40, so you can't expect the same intonation as from a professional instrument, but it works just fine for a beginner.  The materials are great, with real wood all around.  The only thing is that the rainbow strings that come with the instrument are utter shite.  No matter how much you get them stretched out, they keep stretching.  Not just between playing sessions, but *during* playing sessions.  I got a set of D'Addario Platinum soprano strings and am much happier.  They got bedded in and stretched out within one or two sessions and now the instrument sounds just fine.  I would have liked a low-G string, but I'll take care of that later.TL;DR: I can recommend this, but don't use the strings that come with it.  Get better ones.",everjoys-Soprano,S. Ayengar

I am so glad I purchased the soprano with the tuner and bag. I used the tuner often and with out it I would be very frustrated trying to tune on my own as often as I do. The warm brown color was beautiful and the size perfect for my inexperienced hands. The strings are not painful like guitar strings are. I am average size for an adult and this  soprano size fit well for me. Would also work well for a child.  A larger person may prefer a bigger baritone or concert size tho. I am glad the bag is sturdy because I plan to take this baby with me everywhere now.  I didn't need any experience to play as there are many online lessons to choose from.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2020",Black,Won’t stay tuned,"I received this a couple of months ago but haven’t had a chance to play it until now. I have been playing and tuning it daily for the past 2-3 weeks. My C string will NOT stay tuned no matter what I do. It IMMEDIATELY goes out of tune (within seconds of playing) and I have tried several different things to correct the issue but nothing helps. I believe it’s because the peg wobbles. I have tightened down all the screws and it still wiggles back and forth when all the other pegs are solid in place and good quality. This is beyond frustrating. I had hoped the metal pegs would make it a decent quality uke but it looks and feels cheap. On top of that has a twangy sound (which could just be how sopranos sound).Do not get a soprano if you are a larger person. When I saw the reviews that said it’s great for beginners I believed them but it’s difficult to hold correctly unless you are a smaller person or child. Thank goodness for the neck strap. SO Please do your research outside of amazon reviews to get the right size for you.I do love that it came with an extra string (yes ONE, and I’m not sure if it’s G or A but it’s a thinner string. I thought it would come with 4 extra strings so was disappointed that this wasn’t the case) picks, a neck strap and a tuner. This is all very helpful for a beginner. The bag is just a flimsy canvas material and will not protect your instrument very well.This is an ok starter if you are a beginner like me BUT you will need to upgrade to a better quality uke. So if you can afford it I would just start with a better quality one to begin with.",everjoys-Soprano,Amazon Customer

As with any new uke, it’s takes a few days of constantly tuning and stretching the strings to break them in and get them settled. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the quality of the strings is a little more “twangy” than my preference for a traditional ukulele sound...but the timbre of the strings did improve slightly as the strings were broken in. All the accessories that come with this set are great,too. The tuner is fantastic and has multiple settings for tuning many instruments and is very easy to use/read for those who may not have a lot of musical experience.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020",Rainbow String,Was Undewhelmed.. Updated!,"My new years resolution this year was to learn an instrument. I figured it might be pretty easy to learn on a uke since it's small and only has a few strings. Since I wasn't sure if I'd be any good at figuring out chords, I chose this inexpensive ukulele, thinking it would be a good start. And it had lots of positive reviews. But, unfortunately, The minute I start strumming, the strings go off key so 4-5 notes in, I'm off key. It's making learning to play really frustrating.UPDATE: I talked to my friend about my issues and he told me that I should just keep tuning and strumming and tuning and strumming for a couple hours to work the strings out. Well, it took almost 3 hours of strumming but it's finally able to hold the note for long periods. I adjusted my stars.",everjoys-Soprano,JillLovesToRead

More toy than instrument.,"I don't know what I expected getting a painted instrument: the sound was muted and was exacerbated by the flimsy strings. Within minutes, the tuning would start to go flat as the strings got broken in and stretched but it was constant for the day we had it. I'm almost certain it wasn't loose pegs since I kept and eye on their position between tuning the strings. Maybe with better strings this would be more instrumental, but as it stands, I returned this and opted to spend more $$ and go to my local guitar shop and get a proper instrument.",everjoys-Soprano,tmoz

Yes, we are aware that you do have to tune a ukulele and guitar often at first.  But this seems extraordinarily hard to keep tuned.

It has a very nice sound, first time using it it went out of tune because of new strings. Picks are made of plastic and the electronic tuner has a battery with it in between the clasp when you open it new. The strap is a little small for me because it is 22 inches long (55.88 centimeters) and the Ukulele is about 21 inches (53.34 centimeters) It seems like a good beginner product. It needs plenty of tuning. Once you get it tuned it sounds great. Everything was packaged pretty well and I had no complaints since I received it. All in all it is a great beginner Ukulele, the strap is a little small because I have a rather large chest.  It isn’t a deal breaker.

I purchased it for my son's 5th birthday, as my 10yo started playing violin and he was jealous. It's perfect to make him feel like he has his own instrument, that I'm not terribly concerned if he takes everywhere and breaks eventually down the line. He loves playing it, wearing it in the bag on his back, and the included tuner was ideal, for keeping him in tune. It's a perfect little set, would definitely buy again for a beginner string instrument.",everjoys-Soprano,Amy

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019",Rainbow String,Item was defective - UPDATED,"This Ukulele is cheaply made, but you get what you pay for. I wasn't expecting fine quality, but at least something that would hold a tune for more than 30 seconds. The G string tuner nut is not installed properly and will not tighten down to hold the string in tune at all. I have not contacted the company yet about the defect, so I will update this review once I find out what kind of customer service they provide and how well they stand behind their product when it is defective.UPDATE #1 - I contacted the company and they are sending a replacement ukulele. They did not ask me to send the defective one back. They also said they upgraded the ukulele to a ""better quality"" one than I bought. I'm giving three stars for customer service, not for the ukulele. I will update again when the new one arrives.UPDATE #2 - We received the new upgraded ukulele, which is this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SGHGZMG/ref=emc_b_5_t. It is definitely better quality and stays in tune. The gig bag on the new one has a pocket on the front which helps contain the picks, tuner, etc. - the original did not have an accessory pocket. The review on the original ukulele is going back to a one-star only because of the quality of the product (manufacturer); however, due to the excellent customer service I received (seller), I am going to leave a new review on the replacement ukulele link.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2019",Blue,Excellent for the price.,"This is not a professional instrument. It is designed to be a super cheap option to learn the basics on while you decide what you, personally, really want from your uke. For that, this is an ideal set at an incredible price. Aside from the gig bag, the accessories were awesome. The tuner is great. Kiddo loved the harmonica; I could have lived w/o since I don't play or care to play harmonica. Maybe the offspring will learn on it's own. The gig bag opens at the bottom instead of along the side making it a PITA to get the uke in or out. It is also made of cheap materials. It will do in a pinch. The uke itself is sturdy enough to survive a child - as long as they don't try to Pete Townshend it on a hard floor. It's easy enough for a kid to tune and play and bright enough to entice them to pick it up. I prefer the classic wood finish, myself, unless I am opting for a waterproof uke. Has a decent sound.

I've never played a string instrument before and I wanted something that I could learn on yet feel feminine. (I'm a girl at heart.) At the age of 36, I'm learning chords. I absolutely love picking this thing up and attempting to learn. I was slightly disappointed by the bag. Ive made sure to include a photo so you can clearly see it is NOT a hard case. The color is bright and I probably should have gone with a pale baby pink hue. (that's more my style.)  The only problem I had with tuning so far as been with the tuner that came with the kit. Since Im very NEW to learning. I had no idea how to actually tune a Uke. The tuner hasn't been able to get a proper tuning on the C string. I had to rely on other methods to tune it. Thankfully, I had the resources to use an App to tune my Uke. My fingers hurt and I'm playing a little each day. If children are getting this for the first time, be prepared to encourage finger soreness so they don't lose interest. As an adult, the pain I'm experiencing makes touching common house hold items sensitive to say the least. (typing is a little bothersome.) The song book has been handy too, i suggest buying additional supplemental material to enhance the experience of learning, especially if Internet resources are not an option. You wont have enough to keep someone engaged in learning with just this kit alone. In all I am so in love with this Uke. She's perfect for a beginner. I will be investing in a larger more expensive uke as my skill progresses.",everjoys-Soprano,Michelle Schultz

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019",Rainbow String,Great ukulele for beginners,"All in all, this was a great purchase. The warning to keep tuning and give the instrument and wood time to adjust to the surroundings was key. Its been a few days since I got my ukulele and I have to tune it VERY frequently. Most of the tutorial videos I've been watching are telling me that this eases up in time as the instrument gets used to the climate (currently in CA). The sound is great. I opted for the one with multicoloured strings to help me visually. I really enjoyed that the kit came with picks and a free harmonica. My main problems with the set and for not giving the product 5 stars are as follows; there are no instructions on how to use the neck strap and it is unclear. Google searches have also not been helpful with this. The ukulele itself does not have any spots to connect a regular strap. The tuner that comes with the set is also not very easy to use. There are minimal instructions on how to use it and I found that it did not pick up sound very well from the instrument. Ultimately I ended up downloading a tuning app on my phone for free. These, of course, are very minor, which is why I still rated the product highly. I hope to continue learning the instrument and pick up harmonica. All in all, I think this is a great kit for beginners for the price.",everjoys-Soprano,AmyC

Impulse bought this one as it was a good price and my other one was already over $100 and I wasn’t trying to spend that much again. I should’ve just spent the extra money to ship my old one to me honestly. The strings on this take forever to stay in tune and even then don’t hold very well. When it’s finally “in tune” it still sounds terrible. I wasn’t happy with it at all but hey it was cheap so I got what I paid for. The tuner on it doesn’t work nearly as good as any app tuner you can download on your phone by the way. It gives false positives of being in tune.

The color (mahogany) is bright & beautiful and texture of the body feels good. I found a few dents on the head and neck but it's okay with me.It is easy to tune thanks to the digital tuner that came with the uku but it seems like the tuners on the uku don't hold the strings tightly, I need to tune again after playing a bit. Or it could be a beginner's mistake.Only one thing disappointed me is the zipper pull of gig bag is missing. But overally this kit is really good for beginners who want to try and get used to uku for the first time!Updated: It's been 2 weeks I have been playing this uke, and I love it so much. It sounds clear, loud enough, and beautiful. The tuning issue I had is not happening anymore. Of course, I need to check and tight the strings just a little bit before playing it but they are not way off, they stay in tune.

Well this year was so special because I pulled the name of 12 year old Javier and all he wanted for Christmas was a Ukulele.  He wanted to sing Happy Birthday to his family because they were a musical family and he always wanted a Ukulele.

So this review may change later. Also - I’m posting a review so early because apparently you post a review and they send you free gifts. Worth a shot.I knocked off a star because the instructions for using the digital tuner are sketchy at best. Just do a quick YouTube search and you’ll find something to help.It came in a (ridiculously) huge box. Everything that was supposed to be included was included (plus a harmonica that I wasn’t expecting). It tuned up quickly after I found the YouTube video. The colored strings seem like they’ll be helpful when my son’s learning to play. Definitely get a different music book. Again the “instructions” are sketchy at best.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019",Black,"This is great to start your Ukulele journey.  Sounds good, and a great price!","I purchased the black one, which matches the color of my guitars. I have not spent any time with the ukulele before, but really wanted to learn. This is the perfect entry into the world. The fact that it not only comes with a tuner, but it is a chromatic tuner, so it works well for tuning the dulcimer I own as well (It can also do tuning for both standard ukulele turnings C and D).  The sound it produces sounds like a ukulele! Exactly what you would want!  I can not recommend this highly enough for anyone who wants to start playing.A few things to note ESPECIALLY if you have never played before.1. Your strings WILL NEED TO STRETCH (It will seem like the thing is falling out of tune in mere minutes, it technically is but it's not that anything is bad - there are tutorials on how to stretch)2. You MUST TUNE IT WHEN YOU GET IT!  This is common knowledge, but if this is your first instrument you might think you can just play it out of the box.  The cool thing is that it comes WITH the tuner, it really is everything you need to start playing.3. If you played guitar before, you might freak out that they ""Strung it wrong"" They did not, thicker strings are in the middle, with thinner outsides (Re-entrant style)With this order I got a bonus, which was a 10-hole harmonica - It actually sounds really great, not like a kids harmonica , but an actual musical instrument.",everjoys-Soprano,Panther

The mahogany ukulele is solid and produces a great sound. Our other ukulele has a tin can sound to it but this one is more rugged and solid so it doesn't give off an echoing noise.The carrying case is much better than the one that came with my husband's and the tuner and strap were great additions. Before we had a tuner, we were using an app on our phone but since we got the tuner we stopped using the app completely because it's so easy to use.My only complaint is the strings. The strings on my husband's ukulele are easier to hold down than the strings on this one. I have to press so hard to hold down these strings, it actually makes the tips of my fingers go numb.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2019",Rainbow String,"Great starter Uke for someone interested in starting the journey, with some caveats.","I'm giving this item 4 stars, because even though it requires a small effort to make it a good instrument, it's perfectly in line with its price range and arrived as described. A lot of other reviews complain about this Uke not being able to hold a tune. I found I had the same issues, but quickly identified the culprit.  The tuning pegs not securely screwed in to the head and the provided strings are what you would find on a toy. But Strings are a consumable on a Uke, the strings that ship with an inexpensive instrument always lower quality and you should consider replacing them on most sub 80 dollar Ukes if you want it to sound good and tune well.The tuning pegs are an easy fix, just tighten the screws on the back of the head. Takes less than a minute. The strings however are going to cost about 5 dollars for decent strings and about 30 minutes to swap them out the first item you do it.With both of those fixes in place the ukulele is well worth the price if you have a young child looking to learn the instrument. I'd recommend just tossing some 5 dollar Aguila strings in your cart alongside it, and make sure you account for those when price comparing.",everjoys-Soprano,Bill C.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2019",Rainbow String,This is ONLY a toy!,"I was so excited to gift this to our 7yr old for Christmas. Music is a big part of our lives & she just started showing serious interest- talking about playing a guitar & singing. So I figured I would get her this. To start.Yes- I’m very aware this is not some super high quality, top of the line instrument. But I didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars either on something that would turn into all of 2 weeks of interest. So I thought this was a great jumping off point.Good news- not just a phase. Having this has definitely ignited something further in her. To the point where she locks herself away with it, a pencil & paper and writes songs. It’s beautiful to watch.Bad news- it’s also an endless source of frustration for us both because it NEVER F¥€£IN HOLDS ITS TUNE!!!  It comes with a digital tuner too which I thought was great. And it is. The tuner is wonderful & it’ll be easily transferable to our next string instrument I believe. But one of the strings particularly is SO hard to tune correctly & then by the time you think they’re all good to go, do one final check again & discover at least one note is off. Again. It’s never ending.So now that my passionate girl is trying to really dig into this, she can’t because it always sounds wonky. It always sounds flat. Something is always off.So if you wanna make a very small child feel special with a fancy toy- this is perfect. If anyone of any age is genuinely wanting to play an accurate tune- forget it. Just spend the extra money on another. Check out your local pawn shop or used instrument store. Get a REAL instrument. Not this toy.",everjoys-Soprano,Amy Maloney

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2019",Rainbow String,Get What You Pay For,"My wife has wanted a ukulele for a long time, but she's never played before. I thought it would be nice to get her a beginner ukulele and surprise her with it, and with learning a song to serenade her with. I got this kit because the price was right and I thought it would be a great way for us *both* to learn. The ukulele feels solid enough, and the accessories this kit comes with are great. However, the ukulele will not stay in tune. At all. I have tuned it using the included tuner. I went out and bought another, more expensive tuner thinking maybe the issue is the tuner itself. Nope. Perfectly in tune (by both tuners standards) and after playing it for 5 minutes, the uke is way, way, WAY out of tune. I brought it to a local music shop to pay to have it tuned, thinking maybe it was just me. After leaving the uke there all day, when I went to pick it up, the guy at the music store told me he wasn't charging me because he couldn't get it to stay in tune either. He offered to adjust the tuning mechanism, but honestly, that would have cost me more than just buying a brand new ukulele.",everjoys-Soprano,Daniel

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2019",Rainbow String,An okay uke for beginners,"For a beginner uke, this is a solid 3.5. This was my first uke and I had a strong motivation to learn how to play. However if you’re looking for a uke to play just because, or if you don’t have much excitement beforehand, this would be a hard ukulele to start with. The action on it is a little too high for a beginner. Its harder to press down on the strings which can easily drive away someone who’s not very serious about learning. The last picture is this ukulele beside my concert sized. I paid about 60$ more for it and the difference makes this one look like a kid’s toy. I played this soprano for several weeks and I thought ukuleles were just supposed to sound this way, but when I realized I was serious about playing I was willing to invest a little more into the hobby.In conclusion:For beginners with high motivation on a budget, this uke is for you.For beginners with a wider price range, I suggest looking into brands like flight and Luna. You can get a nice sounding uke for only 100$I recommend this ukulele if you’re looking to start but don’t want to spend too much. However if you’ve played high quality ukes before, you’ll immediately notice the difference.Disclaimer?? : the concert ukulele in the last pic is a Elise ecklund’s signature uke with flight",everjoys-Soprano,lee

But then we tried to tune the Ukulele with the included tuner. The tuner barely worked and I wound up using an app on my phone. I managed to get the strings tuned but as soon as I started playing it, the strings would slip out of tune, making it impossible to play properly. There are better options out there - pay a little more and get something that will perform correctly.UPDATE 1/4/19I received an email from them asking me to remove my 1 star review for a ""professional ukulele"" or a refund.

I even tightened the screws on the tuning nuts hoping they would stay in place.  My daughter went from loving music class and wanting her own instrument to practice to a frustrated, disinterested student which is what bothered me the most.  I'm sending this back and hoping for a refund and going to a local music store so I can actually see and hear what I'm getting.As for the Asurian protection plan;  don't waste your time or money on that either.

It arrived on time and exactly as described.  I've never played a string instrument before so I cannot comment on the quality levels of this instrument.  However, with a little youtube instruction the kid is able to play a few tunes, tune the instrument with the provided tuner, and play these tunes without burning my ears. She absolutely loves it an carries the thing with her everywhere.  The sound of the instrument is as expected, and know that it isn't that of a high quality instrument- but she is a beginner.  If she decided in a couple weeks she was no longer interested, I would already feel it was money well spent and would re-gift/share with someone else.  It's absolutely perfect.",everjoys-Soprano,chrometoaster

This was a gift for my young son (5 years old), and he loves it.  It is totally appropriate for a young child.  The case is cheap quality and doesn't have a pocket to store the extra strings or tuner.  The book doesn't actually tell one how to play the instrument, just gives some tabs for a few songs.  The strings are the worst, though.  They are made out of a cheap plastic that stretches.  So when you try to tune the ukulele, you can never get it tight enough to reach the desired pitch before it stretches out again.",everjoys-Soprano,Lindsay A Erickson

For the price this uke surely deserves 5 stars. Everything works and works well. This is a serious very inexpensive option for a starter set.Don't get me wrong, when my child learns three songs I promised her a Kala, but this Uke will not go to waste as two of her younger siblings are already begging to take over this one. Update: She learned 3 songs easily from tutorial book included, simplistic but she learned them hardly asking daddy for help, so props to let book too.As to the many who complain about its staying in tune, I have noticed it is sensitive to humidity & temperature. Do not see it as big problem. After a couple days it evened out & all ukuleles have this problem. Tuner included makes it easy to tune it in under a minute.As to set-up: Nut was at good height. When I filed saddle down to allow about 3mm at 12th fret intonation was perfect, not just acceptable, PERFECT, pretty amazing on uke at this price.Adding a thought here on this cute little uke: Just finished evaluating all uses in pic & my kids (5-10) & I found the rainbow strings the most pleasant to play.

That may take weeks, if my experience is any guide.  A uke from a music store may have the strings already stretched out and stable but you may pay more.",everjoys-Soprano,David H

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2018",Mahogany,It's Okay,"This is a beginner package for a 5yr old and we got one for our 10yr old as well.  It's a fake wood ukulele which somewhat stays in tune.  The strings are nylon and easy on the hands, and the tuners for the most part keep it in tune.  If you're looking for a high quality ukulele, again this is a beginner package to get you going.  I'm giving it 3 stars because this package was exactly what was described, and it provides hours of music time for the kids as they explore what interests them, while not making me bankrupt.  I took 2 stars away because the one thing which I did not like is how they said it was, ""SUPERIOR-QUALITY CRAFTSMANSHIP"" because it's not, also the bag included is not even padded, it's thin nylon.  Of course this is an entry level beginner package, so don't expect any of the included accessories to be high quality.  They are not, nor are they good quality, they are maybe what would be considered adequate.

I wasn't sure about getting one with a strap and buttons at first since I had not seen many options set up with one. For me the strap has become the most used accessory with this bundle, it has become extremely handy in keeping the ukulele with me for the many hours of practice it is taking for me to learn.The tuner is compact and easy to use. The instruction book that’s included shows you how to use the tuner to get the ukulele just right. I rarely use the picks but have attached the pick holder to the ukulele near the neck so they are out of the way but handy if needed.The bag is very simple but serves the purpose with a handle and a shoulder strap. I may want to upgrade to a more padded bag someday with more storage space in the external pockets.",everjoys-Soprano,J

It does go out of tune extremely quickly at first, but the more you retune it and play it the longer it lasts.

I was overjoyed to get the gift, after weeks of antipation and excitement. The thing is, I know ukuleles take a while to get them to stay in tune, but it went out of tune abnormally fast. I’d finish tuning one string, and when I came back a few minutes later, it had already gone out by 4+ notes. So I never actually got to play it. Later in the day, I was tuning it, and the G string popped, I may have gotten it too tight, but nothing seemed to be going right with this ukulele. Also, I was extremely disappointed to find that the carrying case was horrible. It was paper thin, with no pockets and inconvient to get the ukulele in and out.I plan on getting the strings changed on the ukulele, but if that doesn’t help I’ll be returning it.

While it purports to be a beginner's instrument, the bridge is way too high, causing the strings to be ridiculously high over the soundhole.  This instrument does not have a good sound.  The intonation is unforgivingly horrible.  You can tune GCEA but fret any note and it'll almost certainly be 25% sharp.  The strings have settled down and can stay in tune when not fretted, but simple G chords still sound plinky and out of tune.  I realize that it's a cheap instrument but it's not useable.  I've had great luck with a Donner Concert Uke which I purchased for about $20 more.  The tone on the Donner is far better than it is on this.  I'll be returning this.",everjoys-Soprano,Tango Lima

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2017",Rainbow String,Doesn't hold pitch after a week of daily tuning. Hard for a child to play.,"I bought this as a first instrument for my 4-year-old. I wasn't too worried about the quality, just that it would be functional enough for him to learn some basics and stay excited about music. Unfortunately, after keeping it inside in a stable environment for two weeks and tuning it EVERY DAY for the past week, it still doesn't hold pitch. Two of the strings de-tune seconds after being tuned. The other two will drop a half step to a whole step overnight. I play several other stringed instruments and also got a slightly more expensive ukelele for myself on Amazon so I could play with my kid. The better ukelele (a Kala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano Ukulele) needed to be tuned a lot on the first day, adjusted a bit on the second day, and has kept its pitch well since then.There's one other problem with this ukelele: the bridge and bar at the top of the neck are both extremely high, which means that you have to exert a LOT of pressure to keep the strings down. It's nothing compared to a steel-string guitar or anything, but my 4-year-old refused to play the instrument because it hurt his fingers. He preferred the Kala which was designed better and doesn't bite into his fingers. It probably wouldn't be a big deal for an adult, but for a young child it was another thing that made this a poor first instrument.",everjoys-Soprano,RM

This is a great starter set, it is inexpensive and comes with pretty much anything you need.  Although I don't use the case or the book it comes with (I prefer to watch YouTube videos), I do love that it comes with the tuner as I do have to tune it often (especially right after you get it-I am finding that the more I play it, the less I have to tune it).

For beginner, most of music teachers will suggest choose between Soprano (21 inch) or Concert (23 inch) Otherwise, the range can be small like pocket (16 inch) or big as contrabass (32 inch).This Ukulele was made from rosewood and basswood. All strings are made from Nylon. The weight is around 1 pound. Besides Ukulele, the kit also came with one storage bag, microfiber cloth, spare pick, string and etc. The digital tuner is very useful for me. I use it every time when I do the tuning. It is hard for me to get the correct tone. I need to spent at least half hour for tuning at the first week. It will be nightmare without the digital tuner. Now I use C6 TUNINGF: G4-C4-E4-A4. I am tuning my G string little higher for close harmony sound. The company offers 6 colors, I am glad that I pick the Honey one. The color fits me well. I owned this for over months, so far so good. I wish they also offer strap in this kit. It will help a lot when I play Ukulele. Without strap, it is easy to fall when I stand up to play. By the way tuning is needed for every musical instrument with strings. I did compare another one, it seems taking longer time for tuning. For people who hate tuning or pick up about sound, please beware that before you make any decisions. Again we paid for what we get. All the words above might only apply to beginner of Ukulele, music is different for everyone. Every one will have own judge.",everjoys-Soprano,"Little Cindy Riding Hood,Top Contributor: Sewing"

I was asked to buy another one because the one included was no longer what they were sending. I was offered a discount, which was never sent or applied, so I bought a different tuner.

So, I bought this. He is very happy with this. Now, he has started the journey of learning ukulele.The wood used for the whole body is high quality and it is not a toy ukulele, it is an instrument which is suitable for the starter. The blackwood fingerboard and bridge looks so cool and like my professional guitar. The workmanship is fine. It is smooth to touch and the finishing is very neat. The strings are high quality which can be played well after you tune the ukulele with everjoys-Soprano digital tuner. The color string is much easier for a starter to learn and remember the different note.The songbook is quite useful for a starter to know and to use the ukulele.

This is a stretch but the only complaint I've had was with the ends of the cut strings on the bridge.  They tend to poke my strumming hand the way the strings are installed but I helped it a little by taking a fingernail file and rounding the ends over.  When I replace the strings, I think I can prevent this issue but for now, the filing helped enough.

There are minor imperfections on my fretboard and I’m really not a fan of the engraved design around the sound hole and on the headstock. I can’t tell what it’s supposed to be, to be honest! It seems to be a decent instrument for the price and a good one to begin with. I’ve been playing almost daily for 3-4 weeks and the stings have just started to hold the notes, so give that some time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020",Tenor,Great Beginner Ukulele,"I've had my Ukulele for just short of four months now and I'm really impressed. I have some friends who are also learning now and while this is still a laminate ukulele it has a much sturdier and less ""plasticy"" feel to it. Obviously at four months, I can't say how long this will last but comparatively, I feel like this ukulele will be around a lot longer. It has stayed in tune really well and I love the classic look of this ukulele and the design on the rosette. It has a nice tone to it and has stayed in tune really well. It also projects really well and can play quite loud. I have the tenor and recognize that influences volume compared to my friends soprano's and concert's but I think overall this ukulele just projects better than theirs. The case it came with is pretty thick and seems well made and durable. I also like the tuner that came with the ukulele. My sister got a different ukulele around the same time and her tuner is kind of a pain. This one clips on so easily and is really easy to use. I also appreciated that the strap buttons were already installed. I wasn't sure at first if I'd want to play with a strap or not but I found it much more comfortable with and the idea of installing those myself was quite daunting. This is my first venture into string instruments and I've really enjoyed it!",ranch,Beth S.

I've just tried to restring it, but some of the strings have been cut too short for their rightful place because of where they were misplaced.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020",Concert,Incredible value,"Just got it in yesterday but already learned how to play Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's Over the Rainbow, as an absolute beginner on the ukelele (I am a guitar player though). This is an incredible value. The wood is beautiful, and fits in nicely alongside my guitar. Of course it's the right size for children to play too, but as an adult I appreciate how nice it looks in the house. It's clear that it's mass produced, with laser etchings and there were some remnants of the production process left behind that brushed off, but for the price that's expected. What I didn't expect was that it would play so well. It sounds great, the stock strings it shipped with tuned up well, and I didn't have any of the issues other reviewers had with frets being too high or anything like that. For those complaining about the tuner pegs, first note that new strings (especially nylon) stretch out significantly and you will have to keep retuning it until it settles in. And, if you really did get faulty tuning pegs, there is a warranty, or replacement pegs are cheap and easy to install. I also did not have issues with the included tuner, except that it buzzes/rattles when I play, so I can't keep it attached when I play unfortunately. All in all, I'm super happy with this purchase, and can't wait to use it while camping.",ranch,Paul I.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2020",Concert,Solid value for a beginers instrument package.,"Generally seems well built and better made than expected. Nice looking, traditional Uke. Comes strung, but of course very out of tune, it took some time to get the stretch out of the strings. The tuner is a little confusing to use at first but unless you have a piano or other standard to use (or perfect pitch) it's a nice item to have. Had to tune and re-tune the instrument several times over a couple of hours before it settled-in and for the most part stayed close to being in tune. Go slow and be patient.  (I suspect it should get even better after a few days) The extra set of stings are always good to have on hand for any stringed instrument. I was happy this came with a set as I was a little concerned about breaking one while tuning, but having the extra set made it not so much of a big deal. The gig bag is much better than you might expect with a beginners package, more than adequate and is well padded. It is not on par with a Martin or other high end instrument but certainly a good playing and nice sounding Ukulele for a beginner or even intermediate player.  Not the cheapest or most expensive but certainly a Good Value.",ranch,John S

I didn't know anything about ukulele before I bought this, so I quickly learned how necessary the tuner is to making the music sound good.  I also really liked playing with the strap when I first started as I wasn't totally sure how to hold it, move my fingers, and strum without losing my grip.  More exciting than anything is how quickly you'll be able to learn how to play.  I mostly went on YouTube and studied tutorials for a while and made sure to practice for about an hour every day.

The sound is great, looks well made and not cheap like some I've seen. We, admittedly,  are not Ukulele experts, though. My husband plays guitar, so I feel we at least aren't totally new to stringed instruments... So, this Ukulele has the sound, the quality, and so much included with it, this is basically a no-brainer. You don't need a brain to buy this, truly. Just do it. Ok, seriously, I also felt like many of the other reviews for this were of people who had much more knowledge and many more Ukuleles than my 0 that I already had. So, I did go off of the large amount of 5 stars and very well written and thought out reviews. Other cheaper or similarly priced Ukukeles seemed to get a lot of decent reviews from people like me- total newbs. We also bought this because my dad, who has made instruments (dulcimers, and hammer dulcimers) and has played the guitar in the past (and does not skimp on good quality) bought the same for my mom and was impressed by it as well.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2020",Concert,"Razor sharp fret ends, form letter customer service.","I'm updating this review, now that I have gotten a reply from Ranch customer service.Short version: Most of the fret ends were unbelievably ragged, worse than anything I've seen. Customer service tried to be helpful, but failed to really grasp the problem. Response seemed a canned reply to a different fret problem. Intonation of G string sharp above 7th fret, rest of strings show good intonation to at least the 12th.Long version.First, I am not a musician, but I tinker with instruments for my own personal stress reduction, improving my hand motor skills, etc. I have been tinkering mostly with guitars, occasionally with others for about 30 years now.I play entirely on beginner instruments, and am in general aware of what to expect from them. Sure they're often laminate, with substandard tone, that's fine by me. I've had several with slightly sharp fret edges that I've filed and worked. I've never seen anything like the poor craftsmanship of the fret ends on this ukulele.Back in the day, you usually had fretboards that weren't flat, but that's not so common these days as machine-made instruments have gotten much better. Usually you find the frets need to be rounded at the corners a bit. Sometimes you have some fret sprout that needs to be filed down. Whatever, it happens. This is usually on a *small* number of frets.This Ukulele has 18 frets, for a total of 36 fret ends. 31 of the ends on this instrument are sharp and require work. Most have wide, ragged, flat burs hanging off the edges, like the were cut with an exceptionally dull cutter and left untreated after cutting. See the pictures I've attached. Those jagged, flaky looking bits at the edge are thin, razor sharp flakes of metal still attached to the fret. A few of the frets are noticeably short of the edge of the fretboard.Quite frankly, I received a completely unplayable ukulele due to unbelievably sharp frets. Sure, I could have gotten it into serviceable condition in an hour or two with a file. But for a new instrument claiming that:""Light and well built instrument, with the fret boards surprisingly smooth on every sides details, Neck is well connected and easy to navigate, the frets are nice and polished.""The worst fret ends I've ever seen is *not* what I was expecting.When I emailed customer service, sending them the same fret-end closeup they replied with this explanation:""When we ship the ukuleles to Amazon, our QC will check every details of the uke to make sure there are no flaws on it. Of course the fret edges are very smooth at that time. But due to the natural properties of wood's thermal expansion and contraction, the uke's frets may have some bow.""So, you're going to blame the jagged, rough unfinished edges on your fret on thermal expansion of the fretboard?Um, no. The metal ends did not magically become ragged as a result of the wood under them expanding. Most likely they were precut too short before being put on the fretboard, so the ends never got polished down after installation, and QC never noticed.  Later the fretboard shrank due to moisture changes the sharp edges started hanging over. Note the shrinkage didn't cause the problem, but rather the expansion masked a manufacturing defect. This is of course giving a possible explanation on why the edges weren't sharp when it went through their QC.Either way, the QC should have visually inspected the fret ends, at which point the jagged edges would have been seen, even if they couldn't be felt.It also sounds like the end of their email response is about the frets being bowed up out of the fretboard, not sharp at the ends. I think they cut-and-pasted some generic facts about fretboards, and picked the wrong one, this might explain the absurdly incompetent sounding reply.To their credit, they did offer me a partial refund if I wanted to fix it myself, and pointed me to the option of returning it to Amazon if not. If it were a minor problem, I'd take them up on it. but fixing nearly every fret on the instrument is way too much work. Back it goes to be replaced by a different brand.I also noticed the intonation of the G string is noticeably sharp above the 7th fret, but the others are on-pitch at the 12th and beyond. That's not really a deal killer, but a lot of the reviews talked about how great the intonation is. It i fine for a beginner instrument, but less great than the reviews claim.Other than that, the instrument seems reasonably well made. The tuning keys move smoothly, and look good although one has a few minor pits if you look really closely. The finish is thin, but even. The strap button at the bottom is a bit loose and wobbly. The included digital tuner is pretty basic, but functional enough. One drawback is it only shows the open string notes of either a Ukulele or Guitar (selectable). If you are more than a half-step off, the tuner won't tell you if you are sharp or flat. (ie: if your G is really an F#, you get no feedback). This might be an issue if you are restringing the instrument and your sense of pitch isn't very good, but you could use a smartphone app to get close and this for finer tuning.With all the reviews talking about how nice and smooth the frets are, I'm wondering if:1) I got a lemon2) Ranch switched OEM manufacturers and the quality went down3) the people buying these have rawhide for hands4) or these reviews are entirely fake.I'm guessing 1 or 2. A few hundred fake reviews is common on Amazon, but thousands? not as likely.While 1 star may sound harsh to some, I stand by it. They market this product as having well polished frets, these were atrocious. I might have been more lenient if it wasn't an marketed feature. The customer service email I got was also lacking, and really didn't help, even though they seemed to be trying.",ranch,M. Kettler

It showed up quickly and looked beautiful. After closer inspection I noticed that there was a small crack on the side of the fret board next to the 1st fret, then the wosrt thing I noticed was all the frets on the ends were rough and sharp. I felt like I would cut my fingers. I contacted Amazon and Ranch Guitars and I decided to send it back and get another one. The second one came from Amazon's Aurora, Co. wearhouse. It came quicker than the first one. This one was flawless no cracks and no rough frets, just smooth. The intonation was spot on.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2020",Concert,Good quality except for . . . . .,"I have been playing stringed instruments (guitar, ukulele, banjo etc) for over 50 years.  While the overall build quality of this instrument is very good, the nut is too high as is the bridge saddle.  For an experienced player this can be a minor annoyance that can be remedied by removing the saddle and sanding it down to get a lower action.  The nut slots can be cut deeper.  A beginner on the other hand, could become discouraged very easily.  The other issue with this ukulele is with the sharp edges of some of the frets.  On the plus side, even though this is not considered to be a high end instrument, it looks and sounds as good or better than those in the $100 and up range that I tried at the local ""guitar barn"".  The tuning machines work smoothly and the electronic tuner is accurate. The instrument was returned a few days after receiving it because of the sharp frets and high action problem.",ranch,B.B.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020",Concert,Great product a couple tuning points though...,"I thoroughly enjoy the ukelele but a couple reasons for me not putting a 5 star.....When I received the instrument of course I had to tune it as they keep strings very loose for shipping purposes. What I did not like is that I had to keep tuning the ukelele mid-play as it would not hold its tuning. Even after some extreme tightening, it still does not hold its tune especially after I set it aside for even 10 minutes.Craftsmanship is great, except for the price of this instrument it seems there are places that have been glued together where it would be much stronger if it were solid. Also I feel the timing issue may be the use of cheaper materials in the headstock/tuning pegs.Do not let these cons stop you from buying this instrument they are minor and if you dont know how to fix them a couple videos online could teach a monkey how to fix them in minutes.My recommendation after first unboxing is that you get a Phillipshead screwdriver and tighten your tuning pegs all around until it is not easy to turn and you have to use some slight force to turn the pegs...BEGINERS DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN AND STRIP YOUR PEGS. If you do this you will need new pegs and I'm not entirely sure that would be honest if you asked for a refund/exchange if you yourself did the damage. I have not read a review where someone recieved a defective product so they have a pretty good name....I hope you enjoy your playing and pay your respects to the late, great Bruddah Iz!",ranch,Mike F

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019",Tenor,"Baught 2, quality varies.","Of the two ukeleles, one of them is very nice, worthy of a 4.5-star review. The other uke, not so much. In appearance they are identical, but when turning the tuning knobs, it feels sticky. Not smooth and strong like the other. Additionally, on the body, the varnish or final coat is streaked. Not really scratched off, just missing in streaks. Maybe an issue with quality control? Both instruments play well and have great sound. The fingerboard is smooth and action is adiquate, no muting of high notes.",ranch,SunkenDreams

She absolutely loves it and played it all Christmas Day. For a beginner, this was a super choice for us. Love that it came with a case and all the other things included. I know nothing about ukulele quality, but it sounds and looks great to me- much nicer quality than the “ukulele kit” I’d considered in a store a few months ago. I appreciated other reviews because they convinced me to buy this one. It ended up being her favorite gift and she has had so much fun with it.",ranch,Jenilvandy

The instrument itself is terrible (toy) quality. The tuners are super cheap, pitted, and not functional. I'm not sure if the frets are in the wrong spots or what but you can't get the notes you're supposed to get. Of three players, two who are adults, nobody can even use this for practice or backup. I'm baffled that this piece of garbage got good reviews. The Luna uke we have is night and day difference for honestly not that much more money and it is able to be tuned and stay tuned, and the notes you get are what you're supposed to get. I'll be returning this and looking for a functional back up instrument that isn't a toy. I can't believe anyone could learn to play an instrument using this toy, or perhaps given the bafflingly glowing reviews, the quality control is such that some are absolute garbage and some people get a great instrument. I dunno but the positive reviews sure didn't help my decision making and this page could really use some honesty to help other people seeking a functional instrument.",ranch,Lizardcandy

My son's arrived in perfect order and it is such a joy to play.  He was delighted.  Mine arrived broken which I'm having replaced through Amazon so I'm only out a few weekend days of enjoyment and some inconvenience having to send the broken one back.The instrument looks great.  It feels good in the hands and it plays wonderfully.  I'm impressed by the intonation and projection.The strings are nylon.  They take some work and use to get them seasoned so that they hold a tune.  This is normal, natural and any musician knows this about stringed instruments so keep that in mind before complaining about it going ""out of tune"".The extra goodies including the case are a very nice touch.  The clip on tuner works great but heed this advice:. If the needle response is a bit slow when tuning it (you'll know what I mean if it happens) just put in a fresh battery.  It takes cr2032 watch batteries they are inexpensive and abundant on amazon.  Buy a pack now and be ahead of the game.I love this little instrument.  Seeing mine broken in it's shipping bag just broke my heart.  Something so sad about seeing a broken instrument.  Take heart though, even if yours arrives in the same state, Amazon has your back.  I also don't blame Ranch for the condition it just looks like it got damaged once it was bagged up.

Mine does.  You have to realize humidity will always crude minor changes. And, of course, new strings on a new instrument - will stretch for a week or so. The tuner is simple, but works perfectly. The case is great too.  Some commenters complain it has loose threads. Mine doesn't. And if it did - I would just have snipped them off and focused on learning how to play the uke.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2019",Concert,Bad quality control,"Now I’m not experienced when it comes to ukulele but I have pretty good judgement. I’ve actually ordered two of these and the reason for that is that the first one didn’t come with the promised accessories, had a tuning peg that felt off, sharp frets, and a few rough patches on the seams. Now I wanted to give this uke another try simply because the first one didn’t sound bad and I liked the design despite another uke being better rated and reviewed than this one. The second uke that I received came with all the accessories and promised things. I have yet to return either as I still wanted to play the first one while the second was being shipped, but when I put them next to each other I can really tell that quality control isn’t their finest suit as the back of the second one had a more distinct rounding, the frets of the second one were actually sharper than the other, the gig bag of the second had more loose strings that could potentially fall apart, and the battery that was supposed to come with the tuner was missing.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2019",Concert,Same as description,"When I first got it, I thought the string has problem because it keep getting out of tune. But when I read the guide, it explained to me the problem was because of new strings. So it is understandable and expected. The sound is also very loud and clear then strumming it. Compare this to a soprano ukulele, this ukulele has louder sound and echo. The tuner is not quite easy to learn, but I have an app that allow me tune it correct first before learn to use the tuner. After that, I been using the tuner ever since. The case that came along with the ukulele is very nice and padded. They even have the ukulele strap in it too, but I didn't see the need to put in on yet. They also has extra strings in the bag and a cloth to...I'm not sure what to use to for.",ranch,Chris

The concert type seemed to be a good way to start, being not too big nor too small.  Based on the reviews, I chose this one, and have not been disappointed.  The sound is pleasant.  The case is so convenient.  When I am not playing the ukulele, I store it in its case and hang the case on a door hook.  The tuner that came with it stopped registering the C string after a few days.  I contacted the company, and they quickly sent a new tuner, with no added charge.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2019",Concert,"Beginners Only, Low quality build","This ukulele is definitely designed with beginners in mind, which is why I purchased it.  If I were to be rating it solely for that purpose, its a 5 star review.  However, I feel like there is more that needs to be considered.  The build of the instrument feels extremely cheap and is made in China.  Sure everything is, but just pointing it out.  Out of the box it looks nice and I think it overall is an okay product.  The problem is more so when you really start to play it. The chords need to be tuned over and over and over again which is a disappointing feature.  This is a reflection of the build quality and definitely indicates it is a ""cheap"" product.  The sound is good enough for beginners when tuned, but that really is not the case for majority of the time you are playing.  The lessons to learn how to play are extremely useful and I believe may be worth the purchase price in the end, but the ukulele definitely is not.  The carrying case is really nice though!Pros:-Great for lessons and beginners learning the instrument for the first time-Nice carrying case-Fairly cheapCons:-Poor quality-Loses tune very easily and needs to be retuned over and over-Not a great strap-Just okay soundIn general, this is a good option to learn with, because not only do you get the lessons, you also learn how to retune your instrument.  I think the price was great, the lessons are worth it, but the ukulele itself is low quality.  You get what you pay for and thats all there is to it.  Below average to okay product.  3 stars",ranch,Mike the Pharmacist

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2019",Soprano,New 1st ever Ukulele,"My first Ukulele ever just arrived today.Last time I played an instrument was in elementary school (I'm 54 now) and it was the French Horn. Just want to say as a child it was very hard to play most notes accurately if at all. My music instructor back then was kind enough to not put me off on my choice of instrument. He instead modified my music sheets to accommodate the notes I could play and for that I still have a desire to learn to play.So with that in mind; I searched the internet for an easier to learn instrument, that's how I got to this point!Lance Allen makes the included online instructions from Ranch seem easy to understand and hopefully that makes it very easy to perform as well!I did not mark anything for ratings about the instrument being for  beginners or easy to learn. Simply because I don't know yet! I have not even tuned the Ukulele yet. However; the quality and craftsmen ship seem very good for this price point. I will note that all the items listed in the kit were included along with two picks as well. Ranch did on the reverse side of the warranty sheet included a quick reference to additional Ukulele notes and chords. The strap that I received fits on the two posts on the body of the Ukulele and goes over the shoulder, more like a traditional guitar strap.I am planning to update this review later, once I have had time to tune and practice my new Ranch Soprano Ukulele.Update: Well I haven’t practiced as much as I hoped! However the Ukulele is very easy to play once I can remember to place my fat rounded fingers on the correct strings. I might suggest that if you have the same issue step up to the next larger sized Ukulele, it should help out a lot. Not to mention prevent a little less learning frustration.",ranch,R. Baill
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2019",Concert,"Poor craftsmanship - Saddle not installed correctly, problem with string sound, splintering.","I was very excited to receive this product, as I’ve been playing a Kala soprano ukulele for a couple months and wanted to upgrade to a concert ukulele. Unfortunately the craftsmanship wasn’t there, something I was expecting to be great due to all the rave reviews. There are a couple prough splinters in the opening of the ukulele (first photo), and the biggest flaw is that the saddle was misaligned! It is not fully into its notch, meaning the A string is completely off of it and flush with the fretboard, with nothing to hold it up. This makes the sound extremely unpleasant - strangely harsh and metallic. I tried to adjust it on my own but the saddle will not budge, and I would prefer not to have to try to destring, adjust, and restring an instrument on my own straight out of its package and risk damaging it when I paid for it and it should come playable. I am pretty disappointed with my purchase. I will plan to return and reorder one more time to give it a second chance, because all the reviews are great, but it was definitely a letdown this time.",ranch,Elena Yei

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019",Concert,Great Concert Uke for the Price,"I am a K-8 music teacher, but still sort of a novice at the ukulele.  I bought this to use in my classroom to accompany students and to use with the students I teach ukulele to. My students have Kala soprano dolphins and sharks. I really wanted a concert in one of those but this Ranch one was cheaper with good ratings, so I thought I would give it a try.  The rounded back has taken some getting used to, and the edges of the frets could be just a tad duller.  However, for the price, this is a great little uke.  It has a nice, warm sound.  The quality is good. It comes with Aquila nylon strings. Be aware that these are great strings for beginners, but you have to tune them every day or two for a couple of weeks before using.  It plays nicely. I’m glad I got it and would recommend it to others.",ranch,Foda

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019",Concert,Excellent Quality for the Price!,"I am new the playing ukulele I've never picked one up until I bought this, so I was not sure what to expect. This ukulele is wonderful! It is gorgeously crafted, with a beautiful color of wood and designs around the sound hole. It has a bright and lovely sound. It did take a few days for the strings to stay in tune, but that happens with all instruments. After having it for a week now, the C string stays in tune after playing and the other three strings are only flat by a small amount, which makes tuning very easy and done in under a minute. The frets are filed down and don't cause a probably when moving my hand up and down the neck. The concert size is very comfortable to hold, even without the use of the strap.It comes with a bag, a strap, a tuner, an extra set of strings, a cloth, and some picks. It also came with a handy sheet that had all of the chords on it. The case is sturdy. It's not hard, but it's not so soft that it won't protect the instrument. it did have a bit of a plastic-y scent but I'm sure that will air out if left out for a few hours. The tuner works just fine and fits nicely onto the head of the ukulele. You can swivel it around and position it so it sits in the best place for you to see while tuning. The strap is okay. I had a hard time getting it onto the pegs on the ukulele. The slit cut into the ends of the strap are a bit tight at first so you really have to force them on. The strap is also on the smaller side. I'm pretty small myself being a 5'3"" woman and the strap is close to longest it can get. I don't think anyone much larger than me could use this strap. I haven't had to change the strings yet, but the extra set that comes with is the same brand as the ones on the ukulele, which is one of the best brands to have. The picks are okay. They are thin plastic picks. Felt picks are more common to use since plastic ones can sound too harsh for the ukulele's sound. I haven't used the cloth, but I'm sure it'll do its job just fine.Overall, I would highly recommend this ukulele! It is great for beginners and for more advanced learners as well. It comes with a great assortment of accessories that if bought separately would definitely increase the price.  For $60 (price for the concert size) this is a steal. This would make a great birthday or Christmas gift for anyone interested in learning the ukulele.",ranch,james evers

The strap must be for a very LONG person, because it didn't adjust much smaller for me as an adult, let alone my 5 yr old son (who needs the strap the most).  When I wear the strap, it hangs at my hips and is really awkward...and I am average height. For my son, I tied a bunch of knots in the strap itself and it is serving it's purpose, but would have been nice to have a better adjusting strap.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019",Concert,"Good Price/Cost vs Benefit, for beginners/intermediates","This is my first Ukulele (Concert size) and no regrets at all. PRICE vs BENEFIT = Ranch UkuleleThe sound is kool, the fretboard is comfortable and stay well tuned, just necessary give the fair time as usual in chords instrument, like a day or two and no more issue.I used to play acoustic guitar before so I tend to be a lit bit exigent here, negative point: I noted after a week using, the string ""C""  - the thick one, is producing a ""background"" vibration in the contact with the saddle. It's something that annoys if you play more intense or hard BUT honestly should not be something noted by others, except by you that creates such ""intimacy"" with that. Another thing that's cosmetics but guess is good to mention, the silver tuning head are really good however on the back there was few scratches that does not impact in ANY thing but could be avoided with a thin plastic stick (like in a new cellphone screen), since when you buy something new, you're not expected see any marks.As my first Uke I'm fine with that and really recommend, was the best Cost and Benefit I found, it's not amateur neither professional instrument, it's a great first experience.",ranch,Amazon Customer

The last ukulele I owned was the epiphone Les Paul sunburst uke and I will definitely say I should have just bought another of those haha this Ranch ukulele is alright for the price, the tuner isn't the greatest (what'd you expect for a $65 bundle?) But has worked fine the 150 or so times I tuned this thing trying to stretch out the strings (took about a day) haha the neck strap is totally pointless because this Ranch concert uke has the strap buttons already for a regular strap.  The wood is a bit too thin perhaps because when I start really playing there's a buzzing vibration that is not the kind you want coming from the body.  I'm guessing there's a piece of the innerbody that didn't get glued in well or something...  So this is a $65 ukulele bundle and you get exactly $65 worth of brand new ukulele and accessories haha",ranch,Fam Huynh

This Ukulele was just what I was looking for. Nothing too expensive/nice as I am not pursing becoming a hardcore musician or anything like that, but it also wasn't cheaply made or tacky to hold. It had quality looking craftsmanship and built, and it also has a very full sound. I am in my 20's and was looking to have a Ukulele around the apartment to pick up and play every once and a while and I really think that this is a great instrument that I'll have for a really long time.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2018",Tenor,Decent bones.,"Wanted a tenor to play around with low G tuning, and at this price why not?I was pleasantly surprised by the looks.  It's nice looking.  Curved back on this one not what I expected, but it looks ok.Sound wasn't bad, about what you would expect at this price.  So a little plasticy and harsh (only a little, and again, no more than is usual for this price.)The nut was a bit high.  As was the bridge saddle.  So action was a little high.  And both parts we're plastic and not worth the effort.  So I ordered an ebony nut and saddle set and WOW!  Once the ebony nut and saddle we're installed and adjusted this little inexpensive Uke really opened up and sounds beautiful.  With the addition of the low G string, it's exactly what I wanted.  And it only cost a few dollars (and 20 to 30 minutes of easy work).I'm also going to replace the tuning machines.  The ones that came on it are serviceable, but tuning machines are a bit of a pet peeve for me, and a set of uke Grover sta-tites are only $13.  So why wouldn't i?I came to Uke fron guitar because FUN!  With inexpensive guitars, it's common to get a new guitar and need to make a few adjustments and upgrade the couple parts that annoy you.  It's part of the fun. The secret is finding one with a good, straight body and neck.  In other words, decent bones.",ranch,Amazon Customer

It’s easy to tune and has a nice sound. I accidentally ordered the concert size instead of the tenor, and she wants a tenor. That’s the only reason I’m returning this beauty.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2018",Concert,Good sound and good service,"I bought this for personal use to learn to play. I like the quality of sound from this uke. It has a resonance and depth that sounds good to me. It only took 3 days for it to start staying in tune. I played every day from the lessons available at ranchguitar.com and others on YouTube. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks the C string developed a buzz. The folks at Ranch responded quickly to my email about the problem. They suggested several things for me to try to stop the buzz; but it appears that there may be a problem with the nut. They promptly sent me a replacement ukulele kit which arrived within a few days. In spite of the buzzing string I give this uke 5 stars because the service from Ranch Guitar was so good.",ranch,Barbara E. Brewer

I am a high school teacher of 30+ years and for the first time ever am facilitating several independent studies classes. One young man selected the music industry careers as his topic for the semester. I asked if he played an instrument and his response of ""no, but I want to"" started a group quest to find what might work for him. Fairly soon I was working with half a dozen students wanting to try the Ukulele.  One of the young men said he know someone who could play and would ask him to come to teach some of the basics.  He agreed and the quest for instruments began.After several days of research, begging family and friends to help, we finally received a couple of classroom instruments.  One teacher, six students, and 2 ukuleles make learning next to impossible.  One of the girls told me she found the ukulele she was going to get for class. Her eagerness to share the find caused me to slow down and take a look. She had actually found a ukulele that was not too expensive and looked a lot better than the ""toy"" ones she first wanted.  I agreed to order it for her and she could pay me back in installments. Fast-forward to now, I also learned that the young man who was teaching us had a bumper sticker on the back of his ukulele that covered the rather large crack which happened when he either dropped it or his sister sat on it. He liked the Tenor size because of his ""sausage fingers"" and the sound, so I ordered THIS Ranch Tenor with him in mind.I wish I would have recorded his first reaction to this Ukulele. He was very surprised to find out how much I paid and kept reinforcing his Hawaiian ukulele was three times that amount. HE LOVED THE SATIN FINISH because he has sweaty hands and the high gloss varnish causes a slippery grip.  His praise of the Ranch ukulele has not stopped since the first day I let him play it.  Ukulele fever is spreading and I believe we have found one of the BEST Beginner Ukuleles Amazon has to offer.Hope the videos convey the quality in construction, the sound, and the fun of play.",ranch,Tommie J Barkley

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2018",Tenor,Good Value. Good Looks.  Good Tone. Intonation a Tiny Bit Off,"Great Value ($60 kit)Fit and finish is very nice.  Finish is natural - Satin gloss (barely glossy).  Decorative details on the headstock and around the sound hole are laser etched.  Neck seemed to be fine and all notes up and down fret board were good with no buzz. The rounded back is nice and makes it just a little more comfortable to hold.I am pleased with the sound. No serious complaints.Intonation: Intonation was off. Would not be noticeable to most people.  All four strings played slightly sharp at the 12th fret. For you newbies, intonation means the instrument should play the same note Open as when you press the 12th fret. This should give the same note but up one octave.Recommend loosening strings and putting a tiny bit of vaseline in the string slots of the nut.  It tunes much better and the strings don't ""pop"" as yo try to tune them.It was supposed to be a ""kit"" with various accessories, but I did not get the tuner, strap, strings.  Amazon made it good and I ordered theses things separately at no cost to me.",ranch,Bonnie Alexander PhD

I chose a new one. They shipped it out quickly and followed up with me to bring sure it had arrived and everything was ok. The new one seems good, so we'll see how it holds up over time.The decorative ring around the hole is coming apart. When I first saw it I assumed that the design was just burned into the wood. I looked at it this morning and the entire ring is separating from the ukulele . I'm not sure if it is assembled as a separate piece or the wood has broken along the line. That seems unlikely. So now the decorative ring is no longer flush with the face of the instrument. It seems very poorly designed. I wouldn't buy this again and would return it if it weren't too late.",ranch,Brad

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2018",Tenor,Paid Full Price; Received a “BLEM”,"I feel a bit petty, posting a two-star review of an instrument that cost me less than $60; I was not expecting the quality of an instrument with a three- or four-figure price tag. Nor was I expecting quality accessories (although the tuner appears to be as accurate and user-friendly as my Snark tuner). That said, several of the claims made in the listing proved to be incorrect (this review is of the tenor-size instrument).APPEARANCE: I was aware that I would not be receiving something that looks like a high-end instrument; the listing photos clearly showed that the fretboard ends bluntly above the soundhole rather than being radiused around it, and that I would need to add my own top-dots if I wanted them on the fretboard. But the first thing I noticed when unboxing was a huge blemish on the face of the instrument (see photo) This isn’t something I would expect to see on a $29.99 instrument, let alone one costing twice that. The ukulele had a quality-control sticker on it; they must have applied it with their eyes closed.DAMAGED STRINGS: All new ukuleles require frequent retuning as, even with frequent playing and retuning, the strings will stretch over the first week or two. To hasten this process, I will run a finger under each string to gently lift and stretch it as I am tuning and, while doing this, I felt a rough spot on the “C” string. Close inspection showed the face of the string was gouged (see photo). The instrument comes with spare strings, but you shouldn’t have to change them immediately.ROUGH FRETS: In at least two places the listing stresses the fret finishing. Here’s one quote: “The nickel silver frets are all properly seated and well finished. For anyone familiar with guitars and stringed instruments, fret ends can be a very troubling point of contact with inexpensive instruments. BUT, these frets have been manicured to a level that there is no sensation whatsoever.” On the instrument I received, that was simply not true. The fret ends were very rough and even jagged in some places (see photo). I spent 30 minutes with a file, correcting this.MISLEADING MATERIALS LISTING: In one spot, the listing stresses the acoustic superiority of sapele (a less expensive variety of mahogany) to laminate, which surprised me, as I would not expect solid wood in an inexpensive instrument. Here’s a quote: “An acoustic instrument body fashioned from Sapele exhibits a pleasingly warmer and deeper tone than laminate wood.”Upon unboxing, I tapped on the top and it sounded like laminate, rather than solid wood. Close examination of the wood at the sound hole confirmed this, showing the layers of a laminate (see photo) and not solid wood. I was not surprised by this, but the listing text may make less experienced buyers believe that they are receiving a solid-top instrument. That is simply not true.I bought this tenor ukulele to have an expendable instrument that I could keep at my office, so my better instruments could stay safe at home. Even at that, I should probably return it and get something else, but that would waste more time and, besides, I am now well into the prep work (leveling frets, etc.) to get it ready to play. Still, as inexpensive as it was, I feel ripped off. Given the blemishes and poor quality control, it appears to me that I paid $59.99 for an instrument that is worth less than half that. Save your money, spend a little more and get a Kala or something like that, and you will be happier in the long run.",ranch,Tom Morrisey

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2018",Concert,No reason to buy anything more expensive unless you're a professional; a fun new experience for guitar players,"This thing is great!  It's really brought music back into my life.  It was delivered within 5 days, and arrived in excellent condition.  The finish is a nice matte wood that doesn't look toy-ish at all.  The detail around the opening is nice, it doesn't look cheap at all.  I don't feel weird playing it as a grown woman.  The tuner is adorably tiny and very accurate, I just leave it clamped to the end of the uke.  The kit also includes a dust/polish cloth, a second set of strings, and two picks.For someone who already plays guitar, picking up the ukelele is easy!  With about 6 hours of practice over the last few days I've already built up a small repertoire of 10 or so songs I can sing and strum along with.  My fingertips are blistering on my left hand -- being out of practice, my calluses are starting over.  But even with sore fingertips, the plastic strings are playable -- no need to take a day off to let them recover.  In a week or so I'll be properly callused.  I've never played on anything but steels before so this is a new and, I admit, very pleasant experience!Unlike a guitar, a uke is played where the neck meets the body of the guitar.  When played correctly. this little guy has a bright and clear sound, with enough volume to carry over a small group of friends, although perhaps not in front of a crowd.  Its sound can be both delicate and robust.  Who would have thought 4 plastic strings could be as engaging and full of depth as a steel 6 string?Six months ago I broke my right arm, making playing my dreadnaught-sized acoustic guitar nearly impossible.  I just couldn't get it my arm around the body to strum, but I also didn't want to shell out the money for a decent 3/4 size guitar.  So instead I invested $55 in this little guy.  It fits right into the crook my arm, which saves me from having to rotate the broken area.  I strum with my wrist rather than my elbow, which really eases a lot of the tension.  Having had a steel plate installed in my upper arm, I wonder if I will ever have the dexterity to handle a full-sized guitar ever again.  But with this little uke in my life, it doesn't seem so bad!Short of needing a louder instrument in order to perform in front of a live audience, or just collector's pride, I don't see why anyone would need a more expensive instrument than this.  Not only is the ukelele itself worth every penny, but you get the gig bag, tuner, strings, and picks to go with it.  This is a terrific bargain and one that you will not regret.",ranch,Maria

The tones are rich and full, not tinny and plinky. I signed up for a uke class by accident and then figured ""what the heck"", I can try it just for fun.  This ukulele has made the class much easier for me. The instructor suggested a tenor uke because I have large hands, and I knew I wouldnt be able to play a little one. It is a perfect fit. The class has turned out to be fun and easy. We are playing all those funny songs we sang as kids--She'll be Coming round the mountain, Aint gonna rain no more, Skip to ma Lou--fun stuff.

I have been playing a concert-sized Cordoba 15CM for the past couple of years and I love the sound and quality of that instrument, but wanted to try the slightly larger size of a tenor ukulele.  I did a lot of research and the Ranch product received enough rave reviews that I figured I'd try it. It has turned out to greatly exceed my expectations in all respects.Pros:  - great quality construction  - the wood and polish look very rich and don't look cheap at all  - keeps in tune  - fullyw enclosed all-metal tuning gears  - includes Aquila nylgut strings (these make all the difference in sound and play)  - frets are well placed, smooth, and the right height for fast chording  - the slightly rounded back helps make the sound rich and quite loud without sounding tinny or cheapCons: - the included tuner device is okay, but not great... I use my KLIQ Ubertuner instead (it's great!)  - I don't usually use a strap when playing, but I found that the included strap is just okay for holding the instrument, if you want to use a strap at all.  - This Ranch tenor uke weighs only about an ounce heavier than my concert sized Cordoba, even though it's 3 inches longer and the center of gravity is about an inch further up the neck than the Cordoba concert uke.  It feels a little ""neck heavy"" to me because the body is so light, but I got adjusted pretty easily to this.All in all, I think this is a great sounding, high quality, easy to play ukulele that I'm happy to use for pretty much any purpose and proud to take to jam sessions.",ranch,Amazon Customer

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018",Concert,A beautiful sounding and looking arched back ukulele,"I purchased this ukulele because at the time, the product photos showed a rich, coffee brown color, but when it arrived it was much lighter. It also came without the advertised strap buttons and there was some light cosmetic damage to the headstock, but only visible if you looked hard.Luckily, Ranch customer service is good. They responded quickly and to their credit, updated their product photos to reflect the color of the instrument more accurately the day I contacted them. They offered to make things right by sending me a new one immediately, but the color was important to me and the deeper brown color was only available in the first production batch, so I didn't end up keeping it.I've handled dozens of ukuleles before and I have to say, the build quality on this Ranch Concert ukulele is -superb-. All the little details are taken care of. The fret edges are very smooth, fretboard is flawless, binding is perfect, etc. There were no blemishes on the finish and no gaps in pieces of wood joined together like there are in many other models I've seen.This is a beautiful sounding and looking arched back ukulele and the kit has everything you need. I liked the gray bag and the tuner is easy to use and works well. Not that I had to use it much. The included Supernylgut Aquila strings settle in after only a day or so, and there's even an extra set.",ranch,Kiwi F.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018",Soprano,Affordable and Sounds just as Good as name Brands,"My Thoughts:I purchased this a while ago to accompany a 26 Professional. Now that I have had some time with it I felt ready to share some things. First, I do think you get a lot more your money. The 21 inch is slightly smaller than I’m used to but it still played some happy tunes.The Brand is “Ranch,” and this is the UK-21 Soprano kit.  You get everything you need to get started and learn how to play…so good for a beginner and also for someone who already plays. The Soprano model of course is much smaller that a Concert Ukulele hence the 21 inches.  The sound difference between a Soprano is that it’s the loudest, brightest sound out of the 3(Concert,Tenor). I think that when people think of a Ukulele they think of a Soprano. the smaller one.The finish is nice but not as good as a $100+ Martin Ukulele. There is a difference and it’s the wood…this one just uses cheaper wood. Not that big of a deal though because it still sounds great. In fact, it basically sounds the name as more expensive name brands.The last thing I would say is that if you are an adult looking to buy your 1st Ukulele I would probably go with a Concert size so it is not as awkward to handle, but for a kid the Soprano would be on point.The Bottom Line:I can’t tell the difference in sound between this Ukulele and a Martin. If you are just looking for something fun with loud, bright sound, you will be happy.",ranch,"AlmostEverything84,Top Contributor: Camping"

To start off, it looks great! It feels great and it sounds great! I haven't been playing for very long but I have enjoyed ukulele so much that I have been building up quite a collection. And the Ranch Ukulele is one of if not, my favorite. I love the concert size ukulele. The starter kit is great as well, with everything you need to get started. The bag is awesome too! Most kits i've bought come with a pretty rough and basic bag, I love the color, material, and padding of the bag with the ranch kit.

I did a little research and picked this one.  For $69 you get a tenor Ukulele with a nice gig bag, with a spare set of strings and a tuner.  We paid more for my son's Uke with less stuff and they seem to be of similar build quality.(See photos).I'm not a professional musician.  I do play guitar and have always wanted to Uke to kick around on, there's a lot less to worry about when sitting around a camp fire or just outside having fun with friends when you're handling a sub $100 instrument.What an amazing value for a great Tenor Uke!.I was really impressed with the build quality, again reference the photos.  The finish on the bridge isn't perfect, but the body is great, the neck is straight, the action is low and better than expected.  The tuners though, well they are just a tad on the cheap side and are my only complaint.  Still, what a great value, you cannot go wrong with this Ukulele.Note: This is a larger Tenor Uke, check the photos for a comparison with the other soprano Ukulele.I have also included a snippet video of my son playing this so you can get a feel for how it sounds.",ranch,

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2017",Concert,Excellent Concert Ukulele.  You won't regret this purchse!,"We have several Ukulele's at our home.  My oldest daughter has a Kala we purchased in Kauaii while on vacation ($100), my second daughter has a starter/kids diamond head soprano ukulele she purchased years ago on Amazon ($35) and a Lanika concert ukulele ($90 pictured below).  After comparing this ukulele to our others we came up with the conclusion that we could have saved a lot of money by purchasing this ukulele vs the others.  While the tenor ukulele has been excellent, it came solo (no extras) and cost a lot of money, the Lanika (again no extras) has beautiful sound quality and both are great ukuleles, but in my opinion this Ranch ukulele is just as quality as the others we own for half the cost!  The sound quality is absolutely beautiful, and the color of the wood is stunning as is the entire look of the ukulele.  The gig bag it comes with is padded and far superior to the bag we purchased separately for our Lanika.  My daughter has now stolen my bag and claimed it as her own.  I also love that it comes with a neck strap for when you want to play standing up (already used that feature several times).  The extra strings and polishing cloth are nice additions as is the tuner.  Thus far the tuner has worked perfectly every time we have tuned it.  Now my youngest daughter is begging for her own ukulele, and this will be the one we purchase again!  I couldn't be more pleased with this beautiful instrument!

If you're gonna buy a decent ukulele for yourself, spend the extra $10-20 and buy this one. You won't regret it.Buy iiiiit~~~ (lol)",ranch,Terranosaurus

Imagine my surprise when my soon to be prized possesion arrived packaged in a disgusting shipping box barely held by the copious amounts of tape meant to hold it together. The product itself was partially broken, with the Ukelele rattling from a chipped off piece of wood. Something else seems to be off with the way it makes music. It's a nice instrument in concept but I'm very disappointed in the service provided.Edit: they've offered to replace the damaged one I recieved, and I'm moving my eating rating from 2 stars to 3 due to the swiftness of their actions and their willingness to fix their mistakes. Once I receive the replacement, I will update again.Okay I got the replacement. Much better shipping conditions, and I was happy to see the bus it shipped in didn't look like it had just come from a dumpster. This Uke is not broken, and consequently works much better.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2017",Concert,Cow-boy this is a decent ukulele,"This is a really good concert ukulele for the price. I have a lanikai soprano ukulele and the sound that comes from it is comparable, if not a little better. The sounds that comes out of the ukulele is warm and a bit deep. Having aquila definitely helps makes the sound that comes out of it resonate warmly. The construction is also well done, with the fret boards surprisingly smooth on the sides.The order also comes with a couple other goodies. There's a tuner that works well enough, and it's always nice to have a physical tuner rather than using my phone. There's a strap which I haven't quite figured out how to use and set up with the ukulele. There's an extra pair of aquila strings in case you break a string, although unlikely, is still really nice. There's also a case which is well made and fits all the things inside well.For any ukulele, the string will have to be tuned multiple times until it gets used to the ukulele and your playing so this is normal. I found it stayed in tune a little longer than normal out of the box which is nice.The only con I found was the micro fiber cloth. It was useless as the triangular shaped corners started fraying and coming apart. However since it's a bonus anyways it's not a big deal. The price for all of this when I got it was 54 bucks which is a great deal! It's cheaper than my soprano ukulele.",ranch,X. Dong
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2017",Concert,Try it!,"Love this Uke starter set.The Uke is gorgeous and doesn't feel cheap - sounds great.The bag it comes with is lined fabric and not cheap vinyl.  The handles on the bag are nice - for hand carry or sling carry.The tuner is ok...better than not having one.  However, I just use the tuner app on my phone before I pull the tuner out that came with the set.You will have to tune the strings very frequently the first few weeks of playing - as you usually have to do with all uke strings.  I've been playing it for a month and I still have to tune it during play.Overall I think it's a pretty good value and I shopped around for quite a while before I chose this one.",ranch,Damtigger

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2017",Tenor,I just received my sweet little tenor uke,"So, I just received my sweet little tenor uke. It is adorable, looks nice feels nice, it came with strings however they were very loose & not tuned, being just a hobby strummer, I was a little afraid to tune it up. Got it tuned, I think the strings need a little stretching to hold the tune, which is normal. It sounds beautiful & I'm excited to be playing it. I now love it! My big and only issue for now (and I have since updated my review) is that the strap that is included, was confusing and didnt look like the correct product as it didn't apear to have a place to attach to the uke. When I bought it there weren't pics on how to use it,  it is not a ""guitar"" strap. The seller was very attentive and helpful with how to use the strap and has since updated the description and pictures so there is no confusion on how to use the strap. Therefore you may want to look elsewhere for a real guitar strap to use with traditional pegs. However its a sweet uke a great value.

I originally got interested when one of my best friends started to run a Ukelele Club at school and let us borrow ukeleles during the club meetings. They handed out a bunch of these specific ukeleles and I wanted to try on my own at home so I just bought it. (Side note* the club had about 12 of these and all 12 sounded amazing and there were no differences in their sound or structure). Throughout the course of my young uke's life, I've moved twice and my poor uke had to be squished at times, but it made it through without anything broken or any sound changes. At the start, you do have to tune it a lot, but that's normal, after a while of playing and strumming the strings a lot, the uke stays in tune for some solid days.",kala,Amazon Customer

I also like it’s sound; it has that classic ukulele sound, it’s clear and it’s loud.However, I found that the more I practice/play the songs I know that involve a lot of use of the first and second frets, I notice the gold finish of those frets slowly coming off, showing where I usually play/put my fingers on.

This cool little instrument, when utilized with a decent harmonica; a Jaw's harp; and a kazoo should enable you (after a bit of practice) to support yourself as a New Orleans street busker. I do not advise you to move to NOLA, but you probably could. Oh, try to determine if you have any talent, and jack-up your determination. Who knows? Anything is possible. At least, you would have the tools to be a ""Star"".Seriously, this uke is a great deal for beginners or those who play guitar, but want to double on ukulele. Also, it is a great travel instrument, except on a commercial airplane. Never travel with any instrument on a commercial flight. Yet, it is a wonderful instrument to take in your car, on a train, on a boat, on a cycle (bi or motor).

It is SO NICE to have her thoroughly enjoy something that doesn’t require a charging cable or WiFi.P.S.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2019",Soprano,Good sound but very lightweight,"I had ordered a ukelele of a different brand for myself, but my stepson liked it so much I decided to give it to him and order a new one. I wanted to try a different brand for comparison, and the reviews were great on Kala, so decided to give it a try. I thought I had ordered the exact same size, but the Kala is quite a bit smaller than I was expecting. The sound is nice, but it is extremely light weight, almost like a toy. After playing it, I decided it would be a better fit for my stepson, since he is 8 and he agreed-he likes it much better. The other one I purchased also came with a lot more to the kit, a tuner and strap, and the carrying case is a real case, not just a bag to hold it in. It's a nice learning uke and has a good sound to it, but I probably would not purchase again.",kala,M. Bazzano

The case is very cheaply made. Online tuner is not as nice as the clip on kind that is included with other ukuleles. Other ukuleles have a better canvas type case at a cheaper price.

This one plays very well. The intonation is great, which can be an issue on cheaper instruments. It projects well and sounds bright and clear. As with any nylon stringed instrument, it will take at least a day of retuning before the strings stretch and stay in tune.Note: under no circumstances should you pay $5 extra for the ""starter package"". Just buy the uke. There is literally nothing of value in the starter package. Still a good deal.",kala,Jay Coover

The issue came about when in the middle of the night I heard a loud snap and woke up to find that bridge of the Uke had broken off from the Uke body.  Whatever cheap glue they had used wasn't strong enough so the strings literally pulled the bridge entirely off using just their tension (see photo)! Ridiculous.  I did not over tighten the strings (I always used the Kala App tuner to adjust the tension) and also if I had over tightened, then the string itself should have snapped, the bridge should never bust off the body!  Absolutely poor craftsmanship, I would not recommend at all.",kala,Helen

What I couldn't figure out was that all of the strings were in tune but the E and A strings were vibrating a lot and seemed to play very low. Being a noob I was afraid to keep cranking up the tension so I refrained until I finally found an answer in the Q&A on here that someone else had a similar issue and their string was tuned an octave too low, so away I turned.

It’s easy to play, stays in tune and has great volume. I agree with other reviewers that the software isn’t of much help. It wants me to pay more to subscribe. Get a clip-on tuner, which is more accurate and easy to use. I bought this for my granddaughter and now I am considering buying another.

We abandoned that and tuned by ear and then went back to the app to fine tune. It seemed to work better then.Once in the app, all the “instructions” and “lesson” are links to YouTube videos for chords, strumming, etc.She has shown interest in playing with the Ukulele as a fun activity, from time to time, so we hope it is something that will inspire her going forward.",kala,Charlie Golf

Don’t forget to re tune it every time you play when you first get it. The strings will wear down and you won’t always have to but at the beginning you will. The app has useful songs. Although you’ll probably never play them it’s good to learn cords that way and the tuner on it works just like a real one. The case is just fabric.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2018",Soprano,In love!!!,"I'm completely new to the ukulele and bought it on a whim. I own a couple of guitars and let me tell you, this little uke has completely stolen the show and my heart!The tone is absolutely beautiful, and the body appears to be well-made. The frets are a little rough on the sides of the neck but that's a barely noticeable flaw in an otherwise well-made body.This uke is so enjoyable to play that a friend of mine decided to purchase one immediately after playing mine for a few minutes! It really does provide a beautiful sound and is so easily playable that my six year old niece was able to pick up a few chords.The strings do go out of tune easily initially, as mentioned by other reviewers, but that's only until they've been given time to stretch. I've had my uke for a little over a week and it's already holding tune well.I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking to start playing the ukulele without too steep an investment, it's a quality instrument at quite a bargain price.",kala,"Ten10 Ro,Top Contributor: Photography"

I have read other reviewers upset with the Uke going out of tune so fast. I did not have this problem. I stretched the strings a little before playing and I practiced for about 2 hours. I checked the tune then and it was just a little off. I would recommend this for anyone who is new to playing a ukulele to try this one. The price point is great for a newbie.

The app that comes with the Ukulele is also amazing! If you don't understand how to tune by ear, you don't need to because the app has a tuner. Even physical tuners that I have bought do not compare to the app tuner. The chord book is useful for beginners, who don't want to constantly google chords.

When I have the C string tuned to C and I press on the second fret to create a D, the D pitch is very flat. The only reason I can think of why this is happening is, that the frets are placed incorrectly. The spacing between the frets are off and it creates dissonant pitches.

Came without the tuner and the ""soft case"" is literally just a sack... returning and ordered Kala KA-15S instead. This is my review for that uke:I bought the starter kit by Kala and liked the uke but I had opted to get it partly for the tuner. It was missing from the package so I found tuning apps (and YouTube by ear) which is effective and realized a tuner isn't necessary. I decided to try the Kala KA-15S since it kept coming up everywhere as the best for a beginner and works well into the intermediate stages... That intrigued me since I'm learning to play quite quickly. It's not only a beautiful instrument, the sound also carries further and is much more distinct than the uke in the starter kit. Not to mention... The case that came with the starter kit was just a flimsy sack. This uke came with a beautiful, soft (quality!) case. I'm so happy I decided to return the other and try this one.

The Ukulele fit and finish is very good.  It is a bit challenging to keep tuned, but perhaps this will improve over time as the string stretch.  There is a small songbook which is helpful, but the best of all is the app that comes along with the package.  It enables you to tune the Ukulele as well as has a lot of songs that you can play and the app has the cords and music that you can play along with and it tells you how well you are doing so that you can track your progress.  The disappointing aspect of the kit is the case.  The case is made up of a paper cloth type of material.  It is flimsy and probably won't last very long.  Overall it is an excellent kit and Ukulele for beginners.  The sound is clear, with no buzzing.  It lacks the depth and richness of the more expensive models.  I would suggest getting this Ukuleleso that you can try it and if you don't enjoy playing the Ukulele you will not have lost hundreds of dollars.",kala,Donna

The free app is a pretty good one but don’t bother paying for the subscription as you can utube thousands of entries for learning how to play. The app is good for learning the chords and learning how to tune the instrument though so at least give it a try for that. It’s free.",kala,Daebot

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2017",Soprano,"""You get what you pay for"" just isn't true here.","I've never played before and I got this guy based on all the good recommendations and reviews floating around out there. I still didn't have very high hopes because ""you get what you pay for"" is almost always true. But I love mine so far. After a few days of playing with it, stretching the strings, and tuning it's holding a tune longer and longer. It sounds lovely. If I'm honest I even like tuning it lol. That was my first order of business this morning; I got out of bed and started messing with it. It's such a sweet little instrument and everyone in the house has played with it a bit since it got here. I just want to strum it constantly and I'm already thinking about getting Kala's pineapple shaped soprano.The pictures don't really do the satin finish justice either. It's almost shimmery in good lighting or sunlight and has a nice amber color to it. At this price I expected the finish to be kinda flat like cheap laminate flooring. It was a really nice surprise.Now for the ""bad"" (none of it's real bad) :The tuner app is easily replaced by any number of (better) free tuner apps and online lessons are everywhere thanks to a friendly and supportive community. The only real added value I see to the Learn to Play Kit as opposed to just buying the uke by itself is the gig bag and the booklet. The Kala KA-15s is, right now, just about $10 cheaper than this. I think it might've been smarter for me to just buy the ukulele and then spend around $20 to get myself a soft case. I'm not sure what I'll do with the bag after I've gotten one. It's lined and it can be worn like a backpack, but there's no storage pouches and it's very thin. It's not bad for a $10 bag I don't think, but I'm not really sure I needed it. YMMV.I wasn't happy with the way mine arrived either. Amazon had just put a shipping label on the retail box and sent it like that! What it is was fully on display for anyone to see and it also ruined the box. There were two gaping holes in the side of that box and if you've seen an unboxing you know there's only a thin foam bag and the gig bag between the uke and the cardboard box. I almost sent it right back unopened. I didn't know what I'd find in there. There's a small scratch, but it's otherwise fine and the scratch isn't very noticeable. I got in touch with Amazon today though and they gave me a partial refund immediately with absolutely zero fuss. This on a holiday! I've never had an easier customer service experience and I'd definitely buy again (judging from unboxings I've seen this isn't how Amazon usually ships them). The whole thing took maybe five minutes and my account was credited later in the day.I'm impressed.",kala,Krystal C.

I picked it up, tuned it, and immediately belted out some Christmas carols. It does have a little trouble staying in tune, but that's pretty common for new strings. I didn't notice any slippage in the geared tuners, so I'm hoping the problem goes away as the strings stretch. The neck feels very sturdy, and the frets are beautifully set up.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2017",Soprano,A great ukulele...for 7 months,"I gave this four stars so this small review will have positives and negatives. Negatives first.I bought this Ukulele for what it is, a ""learn to play"" kit. I was surprised by how nice it played, and how sturdy the body, strings, and tuning pegs felt. It didn't feel cheap. Unfortunately, about 7 months after I bought it, the higher G string wouldn't tune, and then the lower G string wouldn't tune. I figured I needed to restring it. So I restring it...and it still won't tune. My friend and I took the strings off many times and strung it just to make sure we didn't have any errors. I heard that strings needed to settle for a bit. I let the Uke sit, and a few weeks went by because I got busy. I went back and tuned it, and no difference. I check the tuning pegs and they're very lose. I tried to screw them back in, but nothing worked. I guess 7 months isn't bad, but I still have my $100 electric starter guitar that I got 10 years ago when I began to play guitar, and that still works.The positives would be, as I stated above, it didn't feel cheap. The sound is beautiful, it tuned easily, and the small ukulele guide it came with really helped. Inside it tells you the standard tuning of a ukulele, gives you a free uke tuning app for your phone, and features a few songs for you to learn as well a basic chord chart.I will rebuy this again considering it lasted 7 months, but I hope this won't be an every 7-month occurrence.Note: This was my first time restringing a guitar. I used to live near a lot of guitar shops, who usually do that stuff for free, so I would take the guitars there. My friend has experience in restringing guitars though. It is likely we messed up, but I don't think tuning pegs are supposed to be this loose, even after screwing them on tighter.",kala,Ryan Cripps

It didn't take long to tune it up (used a combination of a snark tuner and guitartuna app). The sound is beautiful! I HIGHLY recommend the Ukulele Method Books as well.

After reading up on various reviews, I determined the Kala Ukulele was a great place to start.  I absolutely love this Kala ukulele.  I was surprised by how wonderful the sound is.  A great value and I recommend this little UK for any beginners.  Its also made in the USA!!!  The short lessons that come with this kit are enough to get you started with ubderstanding simple fret progressions and a couple of strum patterns.  The only dissapointment was the flimsy bag that they try to pass off as a case.  It will not protect your uk.  I also recommend a snark tuner since the uk will get out of tune quite bit when first purchased.  I am told this is normal until you break it in.",kala,SERJERIN

Now I'm wishing she would've maybe bought a grade up for me that was a little bigger (23""). I played guitar in the past and so picking up chords was fairly easy.

The directions for tuning, were a little confusing (he's played guitar for 40 years and it's different), we ended up YouTubing it, but there are great videos out there!If you are serious about learning the Ukulele this is a great starter but buy a tuner! This things goes out of tune every other song (nylon strings). Pops had a clip on tuner which was a life saver. He's loving learning it, and after getting better, he said he'd like to invest in a higher quality one.",kala,Lindsey

I decided to take the plunge and try this one out! Based on the reviews this little Uke didn't disappoint as others have stated. I will make one comment about the strings and tuning. Several people have said that their Uke doesn't stay in tune and others have responded that the strings take time to stretch. This is true. As a cellist I have the same issue but my instrument is a professional instrument worth thousands. The only thing I will add is that I noticed my chords are sometimes not in tune when I play but have discovered that that is not the instrument's fault but my own. The harder I press the strings down in between the frets the intonation goes sharp. I have found that if I am firm but gentle my chords stay in tune. There is a similar issue with cello even though cello is fretless. Pressure can change intonation. Just a thought for everyone out there reading these reviews! As a starter instrument, this is a nice little Uke.",kala,Sarah

Don't get me wrong, the purchase is a great deal because the uke is decently well made and has a nice sound (especially for the price!) but the tuner is just an app that's free for everyone anyway, and the online lessons are also free for everyone. I do like the little drawstring bag that the uke comes in and the start up booklet (though it would be better to have songs that more people would actually want to play lol). I spent my first day using the booklet, and I don't think I've referenced it after that. I've just used the Internet to teach myself instead. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product and brand to a friend, because a uke of this quality at this price is a pretty great deal, but just know that you'll probably need to either buy an actual instruction book or spend a lot of time watching tutorial videos on YouTube.EDIT: several months later, this is my favorite ukulele. I've bought a few more, but without a doubt this one sounds the best. I've even restrung the other ones with high quality strings, (which makes a difference) but this ukulele still sounds better with its original strings!

This is my first uke, i got it 2 days ago and I'm already playing Three Little Birds and I'm Yours.  I really really recommend this instrument, it's so easy, fun, and satisfying to play!  I bought this one that I consider unexpensive in case I ended up not liking it but i love it! it's so pretty and small! its very well made and has great quality.  The strings do get a little out of tune sometimes but you can tune it in no time, I've read this is normal with a lot of sting instruments and this type of strings.  I really really recommend this! If you're thinking about getting this uke, DO IT!!! I figure if i get good enough i might upgrade to a more expensive one.  :) VERY VERY HAPPY!",kala,Anahi

I am actually a keyboard player who taught himself guitar, so I am not a stringed-instrument connoisseur, but I have had just a blast with this uke. Yes, it is somewhat toy-like, but imho all ukuleles are essentially by nature toylike. It took a week or so for the strings to start holding in tune well, which is exactly what I expected. The tuning app works like a charm, too. The booklet might be helpful to a beginner to get started. For me, I preferred to find a complete set of chords at Ukuchords.com and then just look up the tabs for any song I wanted to play. This ukulele has been one of my best purchases of the year.",kala,John A. Johnson

It's been a lot of fun learning to play, but be aware, the toughest thing about playing the uke in my opinion is learning how to hold the little bugger. No kidding. I had no idea. You have to sort of grip it against your body with your strumming arm to leave your fretting hand free. But fear not, there are plenty of instructional videos on the Internet teaching you how to hold it. Or just throw in the towel like I have and resign yourself to only playing it sitting down with it resting on your thigh. Have fun!",kala,Kindle Customer

This is not for any serious Ukulele player but it's much nicer than a toy Ukulele.  So it's somewhere in between.2.  The plastic strings it comes with will stretch out a lot, especially at first, that's just the nature of plastic strings.  It won't stay in tune for long because of this stretching out and you'll have to keep tuning it.  Once it's done stretching, it will hold the tune better.3.  The wood is gorgeous.  Look-wise is very attractive - 5-stars for looks4.  Sound quality is good5.  The cardboard box it came in acts as a little case and the supplied, lined bag is a nice touch.  I put it in the bag and back in the box for storage6.  There is nothing to attach a Ukulele Strap to.7.  Comes with a free tuning app which works well and you can go online for more tutorials and help.  Don't forget YouTube...there are useful vids there that can help teach you.8.  In conclusion - this is a great starter kit.  If you are serious musician - you'll probably be disappointed by the plastic strings and the lack of place to attach a strap.  I think it's doable, but for the price, you could get a more serious instrument in the first place.  If you're getting this for a child - they will be absolutely ecstatic - this is a beautiful piece that does not look like a toy and has a great sound - be aware that the wood is thin and will not take a lot of abuse.If there are any questions, please feel free to leave me comments below and I will do my best to answer them.

With that said, this is an affordable starter kit for the Ukulele student.  It is light weight, and beautiful looking with the mahogany finish.  There is an instruction manual to teach you basic cords, and an app for your phone to tune the instrument.  Does it feel cheap?  I have no idea.  I never touched an expensive Ukulele before.  This is my first time holding one.  It feels so tiny in my arms, but fun to hold and listen to.  It feels fine, and sounds nice to me.  It comes in an attractive cardboard box, and includes a bag for it.  I play Piano and do know there is a difference in quality in instruments given the price point, so I am sure an experienced Ukulele player will say this is cheap, henceforth they call it the ""starter kit"".  It is good if you feel you want to learn, or someone who might and you won't feel bad if you quit because it didn't cost an arm and leg.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2016",Soprano,Inexpensive for beginners,"Keep in mind that this is meant for students according to the marketing. Not accomplished aficionados of the ukulele. This will affect just how one views the product and my review.It's on the cheap side, I'm afraid. You are getting what you pay for... and if you're paying for something to work with while learning to play, this is just fine, meaning it will respectably do the job. And it doesn't ask to so much more. It's a cute little starter kit with online lesson options if you're a self-learner. I like the little bag it comes with.However, it's just not that great of an instrument if quality is what you're looking for. My sister who owns and plays a higher quality instrument had much to say in regards... suffice it to say these things can be made better. It's smallish, tendency to fall out of tune quickly.Though that does mean you have an inexpensive option you can graduate from later, so view it as you will.",kala,Emily J. Morris
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2016",Soprano,Fun to learn!,"I've never picked up a ukulele before, but took guitar lessons for a while when I was a kid.  Since getting this Kala Ukulele Starter Kit, I've been having quite a bit of fun with it.First, the ukulele is very pretty.  It's small and kind of adorable.  It comes with a carrying case and a ""quick start"" booklet.  Out of the box, the ukulele was way out of tune.  I downloaded the Kala app for tuning the instrument, which works well.  I did have to look up a video to hear what the strings sound like when in tune, which was a big help the first time I tuned the ukulele.The Kala website is supposed to include free video lessons, but those are not yet available.  If you subscribe to Kala's weekly lessons, you will get a discount code to a free month of lessons from a different site.  Kala's videos are supposed to be online and ready by the time the free trial ends.  However, you have to sign up to this other site and give them your credit card info.  I think I will wait for Kala's free lessons.With the quick start book, I was actually able to play a song on the ukulele within hours of its arrival.  It is a lot of fun to play and sounds very sweet.  I'm looking forward to learning more songs.  I am unfortunately not a singer by any stretch of the imagination, but my daughter is.  I hope to learn some sings that she can sing along with and maybe inspire her to also learn the ukulele.The only thing I've noticed about this instrument that is a bit of a drawback is that it does not stay in tune very long at all.  After several minutes of playing, a couple of the strings become noticeably out of tune, which really affects the sound of the instrument.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2020",Soprano,Amazing for beginners...or anyone!,"I have the Concert size of the Donner basic beginner uke.. the DUC 1, which I cannot even find on here....but it has been SO AMAZING, I want to share my experience with this brand of Ukulele, as I assume that the DUS 1 was surely made around the same time (since I see that there are now DUC 2 and DUC 3 available...so the DUS 1 is surely in the same generation as the previous DUC 1---ANYWAY).My Donner Uke was a Christmas present, and my hubby knocked it out of the park! We both were doing research on affordable but decent quality ukes, and when I heard how much he knew one day, I decided to let the topic go, as I suspected I had a sweet surprise gift coming...and I was right!The thing is, this uke has SPOILED ME. I have since purchased another uke from another brand, expecting the same or even better components based on that brand's reputation, and while it is great, I can tell you that the Donner Uke came out above and set a high bar!I will share a list of what I like in just a moment, but I also want to say how fun and gratifying it is to have since seen popular vloggers doing reviews of the Donner Uke and being delightfully surprised by what a great uke and what a great value it is!So...what I love, and what set a high bar for all other ukes to follow in my life:-low action. Before I even knew what that meant, I experienced it. In trying out ukes at stores since, I am shocked at how many have higher action. This uke is very playable. (again, speaking of the DUC-1, but surely same generation as DUS 1.-Tone---this has a lovely, warm, rich, mellow tone. I am certainly one who prefers that kind of tone, one that is almost guitar-like, over the brighter type uke sounds.-Tune-ability--- this uke was holding tune from the get-go! Once I tuned it the first time, I only had to adjust it a tiny bit each day if I were really picky...which I thought might be normal. I kept hearing about how new ukes often have to settle in for a month, but that was not my experience...and this did not come from a store showroom, but was mail order...so, it's possible that it was on a store floor before it was mailed, but since it had previously been an amazon-only product (from what I hear), I doubt it. And this was one of the ways this uke spoiled me, because in my 2nd uke, I found I was having to tune it within 10 minutes of playing! It took about a month to settle in with that one...-Accessories--The tuner is great. Multi-functional, even. I have not needed to use the strings or picks (which the picks are the usual ""why did we get this?"" situation found in many beginner kits, since they are really more for guitar)....but the Gig-Bag is awesome! Really great quality for a beginner uke kit! And this was another of the ""this uke spoiled me"" items...because in my 2nd uke purchase mentioned above, from the more well-known company, the gig bag that came with that 2nd uke was shockingly thin, like a windbreaker. Parachute material type. The gig bag that comes with the Donner Kit is very sturdy material and nice padding.  Maybe it is not premium and maybe it is not a hard case, but it does feel like good protection...AND, the pocket on the outside is a good size and actually usable. I have seen reviews of other gig bags where the pocket is so tightly connected to the bag that it is unusable. This one has a good inch or two of space within... Not to mention there are TWO straps, and a carry handle.So...hands down, my Donner uke is my favorite. I am sure there will be more ukes to come in my life (I want them all), but this one set the bar high....but at such a low price.  What a value!",donner,

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2020",Concert,very very good uke for the money!,"ok how about i rate the things that matter the most:intonation: 4/5the intonation is perfectly fine if you are playing regular chords. if you go beyond the 7th fret you start to notice a little bit of dissonance and beyond 12th fret it doesnt sound very good.tuning/strings: 5/5as good at staying in tune as my classical guitars. i see a lot of reviews for nylon stringed instruments complaining that they won't stay in tune. this is usually misleading. it can take a few days for nylon strings to stretch out enough to hold tuning, and this is in addition to a little bit of manual stretching and persistent playing and tuning. i waited a few days to write a review precisely because of this. this ukelele holds tune very well. the tuners seem to be good quality (but im no expert on that) and the bridge and nut are good quality and dont snag the strings too much. 4 days into playing i can set the uke down for a few hours and come back and it's still in tune (well, good enough to fiddle around on anyway)action: 5/5just about perfect. it remains to be seen if the neck or body warp and ruin the action, but that's how it goes with things made of wood.sound: 5/5im not an expert by any means, but it sounds really good to my ears. it's mellow, woody, subtle, deep. but it also projects really well for such a small instrument. the strings that come on the uke are aquila super nylgut (at least on the one i got, maybe results vary?) i havent tried too many different brands of nylon strings but aquila are the best i've used.overall quality: 5/5no rough edges. parts seem well made. nothing loose. it's very pretty looking. the finish is so light that you can feel the texture of the wood.also it comes with a clip on tuner that works well, an extra set of strings (donner brand/no name?), a few picks, a strap, and a case.  the case is really good. it's a soft case but with a lot of cushioning. zippers and stitching seem decent quality. the strap is not good. the ends are shaped completely wrong and the peg is on the neck way too close to the frets so it gets in the way of your fretting hand. it's easy enough to fix if you want to use a strap but probably involves moving the neck strap peg and cutting one end of the strap.i bought this uke cause i wanted something decent to play that was small enough to strap to the back of my bicycle. it was cheap enough to take a chance on and well worth taking a chance on. it is perfect for my needs and holds up to my personal standards. i highly recommend it for anyone that wants a decent quality instrument but doesn't want to (or can't) spend a lot of money.",donner,ben rector

I reached out to customer care and was told they wouldn't cover it even though this is clearly a failure of manufacturing (glue didn't hold) and not due to mishandling.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2020",Concert,Good beginner uke,"I honestly wasn't expecting to get something so decent for the price, especially given all the other items in the order (quality gig bag, extra strings, tuner, etc). But I wanted to learn the uke and didn't want to spend a fortune. Skimming other reviews on ukes around Amazon, I saw the Donner brand was recommended, so I thought I'd give the concert size a chance.Tuning for the first time was a nightmare, but that's true of any brand new strings, and they still don't hold their tune for more than a few minutes. That will improve with time, so I'm not deducting any stars or points for that -- it's just fair warning for anyone not used to new nylon strings who may be wondering what is going on with their instrument.  The sound is good - the concert size is less ""plinky"" than the soprano ukes, so the tone is a little softer, which I prefer.The uke is very lightweight, but the frets are smooth and the action is low enough that it's easy to manage fingering without having to struggle to push the strings down or get that godawful buzz when playing. I honestly was expecting I'd have to take a nail file to the sides, given how many other bargain ukes have rough finishes, and was very pleased not to run into that here.  I also found that while it still has a faint chemical smell from the varnishing/building process, it has faded quickly overnight.TL;DR - this is a great bundle if you want to learn the Uke.  You get everything you need to start (the hang tag even has common chords and how to finger them). Bonus, when I purchased, there was a coupon for a few more bucks off, making it a better bargain than other similar bundles available.",donner,B. Booth

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020",Tenor,Good for the price,"After re-stringing and fine-tuning the saddle and nut, I finally took this to a luthier for help in resolving an annoying buzzing on the G string. The verdict was that the neck was twisted and bowed, but by that time I had destroyed the shipping materials so did not feel right about returning the instrument. So, the warning to buyers is: Check the neck for bowing and/or twisting--if there are signs, return the instrument immediately rather than trying to resolve the problem yourself. This is an inexpensive instrument, so don't expect it to sound and perform like a $200 or more instrument.

The wood of the uke itself is trash, it scrapes, I don’t even think it’s real wood, but a plastic? The ukes sound quality is average and NOT GOOD.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2019",Concert,"Instant fun, sounds great","I got this as an Xmas gift for a music lover. I took it out to ""test the quality"": tuned it up and jammed for a few hours because I've never played a Ukulele. Very easy to learn the chords. I went online and found a few recommended chord progressions and got strumming. Sounds beautiful for such as cheap instrument, never thought about it before but I guess there isn't much difference between this and a cigar-box guitar (minus the pickups and different string material). Great for anyone looking to start learning music or a music fan that wants a toy they can travel with. I will probably order another one of these for myself.I still can't believe it came with so many accessories: picks, soft travel case, extra strings, strap, and a vibration-style tuner! The box that arrived was so light I was ready to curse myself if I accidentally bought $70 of ukulele accessories with no ukulele. I used a guitar tuner I trust so I can't speak to one that comes with it but they're a cheap item no matter what. The wood of the instrument is very very light and soft, to the point I'm afraid of scratching it, so I'd recommend moving to a hard case when you can.Might be worth noting: the shipping box was much larger than the package box, about 4 ft long or so, so if you live in an apartment don't be surprised if they had to leave it with the front desk.",donner,Josh

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2019",Soprano,Fantastic Beginner Uke,"I purchased this uke solely based on reviews, as I had no experience and couldn’t play yet. I wasn’t disappointed! I have had it a month now, and I play it an average of 2 hours per day. After the first 3 days of string stretching and tuning, I rarely have to tune it. Maybe a slight tweak every few days but that’s about it (I’m not gentle with it, so that says something!).The strings it came set up with are decent and good quality. The action is perfect. It has 2 strap buttons already attached to it (one on the body and one at the base of the neck) which is a nice perk. The craftsmanship is beautiful and time was taken with assembly. It has a nice, hollow, rich sound. The accessories it comes with seal the deal! The gig bag is sturdy, padded, and great quality. The digital tuner works fine (although I use a tuning app most of the time). The strap is functional and good quality. It comes with extra strings that are clear but when the time comes I’ll probably put nylgut on instead. It comes with 4 standard guitar picks that are pretty useless for a ukulele but come in handy if you play guitar!Overall, this is a fantastic beginner ukulele that comes with everything you need to get playing right away. Donner has a winner! Watch out Kala!!",donner,Deborah

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2019",Tenor,If you are going to carry your uke in a gig bag this is a very playable uke for only $65,"I bought this to stand in for my 20TM that apparently got stepped on. A word to wise, if you have a uke that you like lose the gig bag and buy yourself a hard case. So I bought this because it had good reviews, was only $65 and my other uke got stepped on. It came in a big box with the uke in its own box wrapped in foam. I unpacked and looked it over. I found one small dark spot on the side where it joins the top and towards the back found another small chip on the top where it joins the side. I deduct one star on craftsmanship but really they are just cosmetic and otherwise appearance is quite nice so decide to continue as was only $65. I breakout the tuner which works fine after I continue pushing the on button until a G appears. The strings are stretchy as all new strings but begin to dial in. The E string knob slips a bit so I grab a small screwdriver and tighten the loose screw then snug up the other three  because I have the screwdriver in my hand.  I deduct one more star for loose screw. GCEA all dial in. I play You Are My Sunshine.  I put the uke , extra strings, picks(I don't use) and tuner in the gig bag which is actually quite nice also. I have been playing this daily and strings are pretty well settled in. I give one star back because this a very playable uke with great tone even comparable to a uke which cost several times as much and did I mention it's only $65.  It's only been a week but I would buy this uke again and recommend as a great starter uke or spare for more advanced player.",donner,lowground

Back in my teens a friend taught me how to play 2 very basic songs in the guitar and then I gave up. The guitar seemed complicated and big and inconvenient. Fast forward 20 years later, I am a 37 year old mother of 2 and had a realization, what’s stopping me from learning how to play an instrument AND teach my homeschooled children? I figured the ukulele would be closest to a guitar in a simpler way, I love the fact that it’s small and you only have to deal with 4 strings and not 6! Now, make no mistake, I did not purchase this ukulele completely blinded. My husband is a seasoned musician, he has been playing drums, guitar and a little bit of piano since he was 8; our garage is full of guitars and amps and what not, so I asked for his guidance in choosing a decent ukulele and after days or research the Donner seemed to be the best we found for the price. He suggested I get the concert and not the soprano, and that was a good choice as the soprano might have been a little too small. I gotta say I am super impressed with the craftsmanship and the quality of it, the body is a beautiful mahogany, even to the inexperienced eye it looks like a high end instrument. This is not a toy like I may have thought in the back of my head! Upon arrival, all I knew about ukuleles was pretty much how to hold it (duh! Who doesn’t right?) but my husband wasn’t home to help me tune it so I was left to my own devices. Thank heavens for YouTube! The tuner included is SUPER helpful and EASY to use! When I say easy I’m talking, EASY! Even when you’ve never touched a tuner in your life! *raises hand*. (Btw pay no attention to the negative reviews saying it doesn’t stay in tune, my husband explained to me that this is normal for ANY new string instrument and the strings need to be stretched and get used to being played so it may take a few days). So, as soon as my ukulele was tuned properly I resorted back to YouTube to learn 2 basics: chords and strumming. Within a couple hours I was playing this song (video), I mean, why wouldn’t I start with “Somewhere over the rainbow”?. Not perfect but this was day ONE, the same day I unboxed an instrument I had NEVER player before, ever. My husband came home and was super impressed with not just the ukulele and its sound, but also the extras! The case and the strap are actually really nice and his musician self approves of the tuner as well. The ukulele is also easy for my 7 year old daughter to handle, and she’s practicing her strumming as I type this. Overall, this has already been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made, and I’m determined to keep practicing and mastering my favorite songs!Day 2 - I’m able to play a song with a few simple chords AND SING! at the same time!!! All in all I highly recommend the Donner Concert Ukulele (DUC-1) to anyone who really wants to learn! A great first instrument for beginners, young and old!UPDATE: 7 months playing DAILY I’m officially a campfire player. The uke turned into a serious hobby, one that I eagerly practice every single day and even bring with me when I go out of town and even to the park on a beautiful day. I now know quite a few songs by memory, I’m completely comfortable playing my Donner uke, and it’s quality and sound have lived up to my standards. I can also fingerpick a few songs which I never thought I’d be able to do! Love my Donner uke!",donner,Mrs.Gal

Comes with everything you might need to get going (though I have been advised against using the picks), and for an impatient person like me, the tuner was intuitive to use without delving into microscopic instructions. Snapped a string right off the bat from tuning it too tightly and was able to quickly replace it with the strings provided. The body has a beautifully rich color and produces an equally rich sound - I'm a little worried about annoying my downstairs neighbor!Tuning issues: Many reviewers are complaining that this instrument has issues staying in tune, and mostly, they're right. The C string holds its pitch well, but the others need continual tuning. This turned out to be less annoying than I anticipated, however. From my understanding, this is typical of newly stringed ukeleles, and the tuning issues should lessen as the strings begin to stretch.Overall great value, in my non-expert opinion, and highly recommended!",donner,Carolyn M Goebel

I decided to keep those two and return the Donner.I’ll post photos and videos for you to compare. I’m not a Ukulele  player. I used to play guitar.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2018",Concert,Surprised so far.,"I play piano, guitar, mandolin and a little banjo, but I'm no ukulele pro. On a trip to a local ""big box"" music Center, I picked up a ukulele and immediately had to have one. I like the tenor ukulele best, but I picked up this concert size uke to play with on a Black Friday sale. The instrument itself has a clear, crisp sound. It actually holds tune very well after you get the nylon strings stretched. It shipped with the strings very loosely strung. The real surprise was the tuner, I thought I would throw it away, but it's actually a good tuner. I use Snark tuners on all my other string instruments and I clipped one of them on the uke with the included ""Donner"" branded tuner and they both matched up. Overall quality product, I am very satisfied as a beginner ukulele player.",donner,Paladin

I've been able to pick them away, even sanded a few down. It is ok now. Still sometimes catches on my fingers slightly.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2018",Soprano,Solid Construction - built to last,"This soprano appears to be modeled after the traditional ukes of the early 20th Century.  The width of the neck is wider than any of my other ukes, including my name brand tenor.  That being said, any baritone or guitar player may find this a more comfortable fit than other ukes.  The banding on the neck includes inlay marking, not the paint found on others. The construction  methods used are of surprising quality for the price point of this kit.  The serpentine lining strips, used to fasten the top and bottom along the inside edge, are superior to flat ones usually found in inexpensive instruments, giving this soprano structural stability.  Minor finish imperfections are to be expected.  The tone is clean and loud, no buzzing or other unexpected sounds. The use of Aquila strings would be an improvement in overall sound and performance.The case is a well fitting durable cloth case with a sizable pocket that easily fits all the accessories included with the kit.  All accessories are working as expected, after several months of use.  Good kit to travel or camp with at good price.",donner,Randy Blair

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2018",Tenor,Fret Buzz,"I purchased a Hola, a Kala, and a Donner in the same week and had high hopes for the Kala,since it was the most expensive Uke, however, the Donner actually arrived with nearly perfect chromatic tuning,and that is what I play most since the Kala still does not not play in tune as well as the Donner.The Kala has an absolutely beautiful finish but chromatically way out of tune to the point I could not play it.Turns out the nut was just glued in the wrong place even though the fretboard was sized correctly - just sloppy workmanship.1/16"" gap between the nut and fretboard on one side and 1/32"" on the other! There is not supposed to be any gap!So I ripped off the nut and put it where it belongs and now it is much better, but the first fret still needs to be filed down a little more.Unfortunately I can't recommend anyone else trying this.I give the Kala two stars because this was NOT a $50 ukulele, and should not be so bad out of tune.The Hola was almost as bad, but only $50 so no big surprise there.Had I kept the packaging, I would have sent the Kala back. however, I wanted to see if I could fix it.The Donner arrived with nearly perfect chromatic tuning right out of the box, and has a nice wide fretboard and meaty neck.The Donner strings also hold their tune much better than the Kala or Hola, I am guessing due to the wider neck.UPDATE: NOW I'm MAD - I purchased 5 Ukeleles from Amazon recently, a HILO,  KALA,  HOLA, ENYA, and a DONNER.The DONNER, being one of the cheapest is the only one with good intonation (is chromatically in tune all the way up to the 12th fret).ALL the others are so bad, they are virtually unplayable to a musicians ear without modifcations.IF DONNER can do it, WHY can't the others, especially when they are more expensive ?The craftsmanship on most of these UKES are excellent considering the cost, but the most important thing in my mind, is that a musical instrument should at least be in tune. The HILO was so bad, also in other areas that I returned it.Most people will not be able to correct these UKES without taking to a instrument professional for repair.This is just WRONG!I recently purchased the Concert Version, however, Amazon prevents me from writing a review on the Concert so I will modify this review.The Concert version arrived with bad fret buzz so I returned it.On the positive side- it did have nice intonation like the Tenor version. unfortunately the fret buzz made it unplayable.",donner,Audio Geek

I'm happy I purchased this ukulele over a cheap toy guitar.,donner,Audrey Riedle

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2018",Concert,3 months later still going strong. Love it,"I bought this 3 months ago and I’ve absolutely loved it since day 1. This is my first ukelele and as a beginner I’ve had a great experience learning this instrument. It is well made and has a nice sound to it. The strings don’t need much tuning after you play with them for a little. You get a nice carrying case with an extra front pocket, picks, strap, extra strings and a digital tuner that works with ukelele guitar bass and violin. It’s been a great first instrument for me to learn and has opened me up to the world of playing and composing, a great peaceful, enjoyable and creative outlet! I originally wanted a guitar but settled for a ukelele to save money at the time and I’m glad I did! Great size to easily take wherever you want to go, I even ride my longboard and play sometimes. This is the only ukelele I’ve owned so I haven’t compared it to others but I would definitely reccommed this product. I have also recently purchased a guitar from the same company Donner which is great quality as well.P.S. This is my honest unbiased opinion, I paid full price and no one asked me to leave this review.",donner,zberrb

I was really surprised to find very little difference in playability and sound between the two.  I realized the Donner was actually a really nice Uke after getting to know my new one.  You get some great accessories with the Donner kit and it's such good quality for the price.  The only thing I would suggest is to upgrade the strings AFTER the included strings wear out.  They give you a second set of Donner strings which are great to keep tucked away in your case for an emergency.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2018",Soprano,"Nice, attractive, basic Uke with accessories.","My son really likes this Uke.  I bought it on a bit of a whim, after he had tried his cousin's and enjoyed it.  We didn't want the toy quality commonly available, nor do we need a professional version.  When it first arrived, I thought that maybe I made a mistake, as this is a Soprano.  As you might expect, that means it is on the smaller side.  I was worried that his hands would be too large.  Perhaps for someone who is just starting with string instruments, it might be.  He already plays the violin, harp and guitar, and he was able to pick this right up and play it.  We have now had it for eight months, and it has held up just fine.  It holds the tuning well.It is wearing on the bridge much faster than his other instruments.  Since those are high-end, and this is one that was purchased for fun, I wouldn't expect it to be the same, and you'd best not expect that, either.  The bag exceeded my expectations.  It is very sturdy, and the pocket on it has a lot of room!  If he strolls the beach with this, he could carry the extra strings, a tuner, his wallet and car keys in there, too.  The zipper is smooth and great quality.  This shipped in a sturdy box, that worked to keep it well protected.  We were going to mail this at one point, as he's moved half-way across the country.  That plan was a mistake, as the length of this makes it quite pricey for private shipping.  It will fit into a suitcase, though, so it is coming along when we go to visit and see his new place.I hope that this review is helpful to you; do let me know, and happy shopping!",donner,Purgandi Dracointerfectorem

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2018",Concert,Great Craftsmanship but I think there's a problem with my C and E strings,"I got it because I wanted to learn how to play and after a lot of investigating on who to buy it from I chose this bc out of all the brands I looked into this one was the one that was selling for a good price and have an enormous pile of good reviews. I watched some of the videos that people had and it sounded great. I bought it during my winter break and so I got to play it a couple of time and the sound wasn't like the videos. The one I have has a little defect I think or maybe it's just be but it only happens of the second and third stings - when I strum there's this buzz sound vibration that isn't the note. It's from the neck of the uke and I am not a big fan of it. It doesn't happen when I play it on the first string. I have only had this time (spring break) to actually sit and play and so I am now writing this review. I would totally recommend this and dont get me wrong, the uke is amazing and the craftsmanship is superb but the little sound defects on the C and E string just gets me and it's unpleasant to play on.",donner,Amazon Customer

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2018",Soprano,Nice beginner set for the price!,"My 12yo daughter chose this set after playing my Cordoba ukulele and she's very happy with her choice! While the Donner is definitely a budget uke, it looks and sounds very nice and comes with great accessories. The gig bag is great quality with a large pouch to store accessories, and the installed strap buttons and strap, tuner, and extra strings make this a great value for the $53 price. It has everything you need for a beginner, other than maybe a capo. I think the set would make a nice gift for a beginner wanting to learn the ukulele. The differences I see between this uke and a more expensive one are that this Donner is a little wider and heavier in the headstock, and maybe doesn't have quite the sound quality of a better uke, but it's still very enjoyable to play and my daughter loves it. I think you could upgrade the strings for an even better sound. Be patient because new strings take a while to stretch and the uke will not stay in tune until the strings are tight. The strings on this uke were very loose on arrival and took lots of tuning, but after a couple weeks of use it stays in tune very nicely.",donner,Northwoodsmom

It's not up to the standards of a professional instrument, but you're gonna have a hard time beating this for the price.",donner,Ben M.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018",Concert,"Wonderful instrument, lousy strings","Lovely little uke. probably a 4.5 as a starter. I bought it for my soon to be 6 year old because she wants one like mine. The wood tone is a beautiful, medium mahogany. The strap is quite nice (especially if you like orange, black, and white which are my college colors). The case could be finished with a softer fabric, but at least it is well padded and the dark fabric doesn't show stains. But the real winner is the uke itself. The tone when in tune is very nice, but the strings that come with it are not very good. They stretch much faster than the Aquila nylgut strings I have on my other ukuleles. Thus, it will not stay in tune as shipped. I switched to a spare set of strings and it worked much better. Ultimately, the plan is to change the strings to a special order set of Aquila fifths strings so that it is tuned like my mandolin, allowing her to learn fingerings while her fingers grow to accommodate the double strings of the mando.Please note, all ukulele strings need to stretch so it often takes a week or two before it will hold a note reliably. That said, the fluoro-carbon strings that ship with this uke don't keep tune for more than 5 minutes. Do yourself a favor and order a set of nylgut strings. I've never had a problem with them that wasn't user error.",donner,Schillil
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2018",Concert,Excellent value uke,"This is an excellent ukulele for beginners.  It's probably from a generic Chinese manufacturer that sells under several company names, but it's been great for me.  My music teacher was impressed with the sound and quality at this price.  It stays in tune for quite a while with only minor adjustments every few days. I find the strap to be very helpful for standing while playing.  The case has backpack style straps, which is nice for walking or biking to music class. Comes with an extra set of strings and a decent tuner. This is all you need to start playing the uke.  The Concert size is a good choice if you aren't sure about which one to buy, but larger hands will appreciate the Tenor size.",donner,k stew

I have large hands and these ukuleles have 1.5"" nuts, that means they have a WIDE fret board.It makes sopranos and concerts very playable for adult men.Quality is more that acceptable, its great. Nicely finished and it includes nice details. The Bridge is a slot, which, makes string changes quick and easy,Side dots on the fret board? Yep, got um.The Action (string height above the fret board) was high and needed to be adjusted. This isn't a big chore, a cheap string gauge and a little sand paper fixes things in a few minutes. YouTube is your friend!But how is the sound? That's what we really care about.These Ukuleles sound great!Seriously, they are loud, and have great 'bark'.I like to string them with Martin Flouro carbon 600's. This is the time to adjust the action.Some folks like Nyguts, which are personal preference.I recommend these instrument.",donner,EKE

My friend recently bought a similarly priced uke from another brand and you could see the envy on his face as he inspected my instrument.  First the sound is great for such an inexpensive uke.  The tuning begs are pretty and once the strings have been played on for a while (nylon strings will lose tuning for a while) it holds tune for a while.One of the main aspects that my ukelele has that is superior to my friend's is the slightly larger fret board.  It makes getting your fingers to the proper chords much easier than on his.The tuner is great!  The display turns a nice bright green when you are in tune.  And you can set it to Guitar, and Violin as well as the Ukelele.  Having a strap and the strap nuts already installed seals the deal.  This is a GREAT value!",donner,Steven Kintop

Some folks have complained that it needs to be retuned a lot, but honestly that is not at all unusual for a new stringed instrument. After a couple of weeks of playing, I found this one held its tune pretty well. It's easy to play, and there are so many videos online showing how to learn songs it has been a lot of fun. I wasn't about to spend a lot of money on something I wasn't sure I would enjoy, but this has been really fun.

And I'm very glad I did.  I got it yesterday and I haven't been able to put it down for very long.  It sounds fantastic even with the stock strings.  I wonder how much better it would sound with Aquila strings... The frets are nice and smooth.  The body is well made and although there is some visible glue along the side joints, you can't feel them.  I can't say it's loud or punchy but it's got a real nice even tone, which I prefer.  The fit and finish is very nicely done.  There's nothing bad I can say about this uke other than the fretboard will need to get some dressing done as it looks dry and maybe polish the frets.I had purchased the Cordoba 20TM ($155) before this but returned it because the G was very muddy sounding and the fret ends were not smoothed very well.  The overall build of this Donner is way better than the Cordoba which was very surprising for a uke that half as much as the Cordoba and  comes with all the extra stuff!

Read the reviews and watched the video by Lance.  I agree with all the positive reviews.  Really nice ukulele, nice sound, comfortable to hold.  The gig bag is well made and the extras are a plus.  A couple of things I don't like:One is the ukulele strap.  It is flimsy and twists easily.  The other thing I didn't like was the white logo on the gig bag.  No reflect on the quality of the bag or ukulele.  It is just me, so I did a quick fix with a black Sharpe.  Classes are fun and I have meant some great friends.",donner,Hotpepper

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2017",Soprano,"Overall, impressive starter ukulele and awesome impulse buy","I'm really enjoying this ukulele after a month of ownership. The quality is great for what you pay, and what you get. Build quality and material essentially meet the standards for pricing. I anticipated having an issue with this useless holding a tune, but I am surprised how well it holds a tune now. Initially my top two strings held a tune well, while the bottom two would go out between a day or two break of playing. I break it out once or twice every few days since buying it a month ago, requiring only minor adjustments utilizing the tuner that came with the ukulele. After about a month of regular use and adjustments, I find it still holding a tune for a few days now, surprisingly. I assume the strings are ""broken in"" at this point. The tuner that comes with is also great, very straightforward, and hasn't given me any issues. I also really like the case for peace of mind and storage. The soprano is a little small, as expected, and I anticipate buying a concert size from the same manufacturer so I can negotiate my fingers well enough to play a few songs I want to learn. Overall I am beyond satisfied in the realm  of cost and quality for everything I got. I would definitely recommend for anyone curious enough to start playing without wanting to make a major investment.",donner,Chris and Andrea

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2017",Concert,Good package at a fair price.,"I have had this ukulele for a few months now and I am not sorry I purchased it. This is my first ukulele, but I have had guitars for years, and I wanted a ukulele to tinker with.On opening the package, all that was described was included... Good start so far. The ukulele was in good shape with no shipping damage and no factory blemishes. In fact, the ukulele is very nice looking. The soft case is also quite nice and seems like it will hold up with use. The ukulele strap is on the cheap end and easily twists and curls, but I don't use it anyway. If I were going to, I would buy a new one. The ukulele itself did have a couple of rattles - one in the main body and one at the tuning knobs. The rattle in the main body turned out to be a small piece of card stock that must have made its way in during manufacturing and was easily removed by giving the ukulele a couple of shakes with the hole facing down. The rattle on the tuning knobs ended up being a loose nut at the base of one of the string posts; a couple of turns with a small open-end wrench and the ukulele is rattle free.Over the first couple weeks, the ukulele needed frequent tuning. This is to be expected with new nylon strings as they have some give in them and will stretch and also since they are tied at the bottom with knots and the knots will tighten with the tension and loosen up the strings. Once all this settled, it only requires occasional minor tuning and sounds great. This ukulele is a pleasure to play and all the notes are clean with no string rattles or dead spots like you might find on a cheaper instrument. I have kept this ukulele out and laying around and it survived the destructive forces of my children so far.The tuner that comes with this package has now replaced the more expensive tuner I have been using for my guitars for years. It is very simple and works well.Bottom line is, if you are looking for a ukulele to learn on, tinker with, or play around the campfire, but don't want to spend a lot of money, this package is definitely worth the price (I paid $69.00). I would definitely recommend this product. If you have larger hands, you may want to consider the tenor size instead.",donner,Craig

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017",Soprano,Excellent value,"I've had the soprano version for a little over 24 hours now. I've been playing it a lot. Verdict: I love it.I'm a fingerstyle guitar player for 20 years now. I've had a tenor uke (a Cordoba) for about four years. The amount of time I spend on my various musical instruments tends to go up and down. Lately I've spent much time on the ukulele. Blues, ragtime, medieval, renaissance, classical.I got this soprano so that I would have something small to take on an upcoming vacation.First, the tuning: many people report huge problems keeping it in tune. I don't question their experience. But 24 hours in, I have to tweak the tuning maybe once every 15 minutes of playing. It has stabilized very quickly.Fit and finish. I'm not going to tout this as a high-end instrument. The fretboard is a bit rough looking in one spot above the 12th fret. That's the only complaint I have. The instrument looks good, has no sharp edges. Very nice. Also, no fret buzz whatsoever, anywhere on the neck. This is what worried me the most.Playability: For a soprano, very good. The neck is quite a bit wider than my Cordoba, making me think I will probably order the tenor version of this uke at some point. It just plays nice.  Smooth and easy and inviting. I'm still adjusting to playing such a small instrument, but after just 24 hours, I've already made a lot of progress along that line.Tone: Again this is not a professional instrument, and I am by no means a professional player.  But I really like how it sounds. Any soprano will have a thinner sound than a tenor, but this one rings out nicely and has an almost banjo-like tone to my ears. I like that. I like being able to switch from this to the tenor and get such a dramatic change in tone. This one doesn't sound cheap or toy-like to my ears; just different, in a good way.Will update this review after my vacation, during which I will spend much, much time playing it. But so far, it's really hard to believe that the purchase price got me not only the ukulele, but a very nice bag (with shoulder straps!), a strap, an extra set of strings, and a very nice little clamp-on tuner. If I had paid twice the price for just the ukulele, I would still be very pleased.",donner,Dim Dandy

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2017",Concert,Great beginner ukulele.,"This is a great little instrument for the price (prime day sale item) and it exceeded my expectations. Unlike other reviewers, I found that after a little time stretching, tuning and playing this ukulele it holds its tune quite well (even with the original strings). I purchased the concert size and it has a nice crisp and louder than expected sound. It comes with everything you need to get started (except picks) with everything individually packaged and in perfect condition.HOWEVER, as a guitar player of 21 years, I have become accustomed to a higher quality instrument. I purchased this ukulele to learn a new instrument without breaking the bank before knowing if I will stick to it. This is a great beginner instrument but I will quickly out grow it. The wood has a few ugly flaws that may bother other players but I will happily pass off as ""character"" and there is a dent in the first fret that luckily is positioned where it does not effect sound or playability. The action is off as the bridge sits high and the saddle is slightly crooked (again, a non seasoned musician will not notice or be bothered by this) and one of the tuning knobs is stiff. I will personally address these issues the first time I re-string.So why the 5 star review with the above issues? For the price, this is a great deal and I am very happy with my purchase. I believe it was priced appropriately for what I got and will get me comfortably on my way to learning a new instrument. I would recommend this product for all new beginners.",donner,Amazon Customer

If this were a ukulele company's review site, this would be a three star uke: a little thin sounding, not the best tuning hardware, but keeps in tune fine and no buzzy frets. Sits fine in the room when playing with acoustic instruments. A good beginner's uke. But, because this is an Amazon review of some random cheap uke from Donner (who I think of as a pedal company), and I got a case, strap, extra strings, and a tuner all for $75/shipped, and it plays pretty well, it deserves the extra star.I actually got two, and gave one to my son, who also enjoys jamming on it once-in-a-while.",donner,JB Fletcher

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2017",Concert,"Beautiful, resonant, a great value!","I bought this on Prime Day 2017 and couldn't be happier with it. It is more beautiful than the pictures, a deeper caramel color, which I tried to capture in the photo. The mahogany grain is beautiful and shimmers as the light changes, enhanced by a subtle satin finish. The tone is rich and resonant. The body is fairly large for a concert, which opens up the volume. The back is slightly curved. The Donner logo is inlaid into the headstock. The tuning gears work smoothly and hold their position, with pegs similar in color to the mahogany. The nut is a full 1.5"" wide, which makes it easier for people with larger-sized fingers to play. The frets are level and beveled on the sides for comfort, and the fret ends are covered. I haven't had any problems with strings buzzing. There are side position markers in addition to those on the fretboard. The saddle is compensated for consistent intonation. The slotted bridge makes it very easy to change the strings. Strap buttons are already installed. While the rope rosette is not flashy, there are some nice stylistic touches in the shapes of the bridge and the end of the rosewood fretboard.I noticed that the nut on mine was a little high on one side due to a glue defect. I popped it off with a pocket knife and scraped the glue off, then sanded the underside of the nut just a little to lower the action. This is something I wouldn't have dared to do myself to a more expensive instrument. (Caution: If you try this, be very careful you don't go too far and cause a buzz.) In terms of balance, it's a little neck-heavy, but it's not something you'd notice if you use a strap.In terms of the accessories, the bag is well-padded, with an outside zipper pocket for accessories and clip-on shoulder straps. All new strings take while to settle in, so it's great for tuning to be as easy as possible. I liked the Donner tuner so much, I bought additional ones (Donner DT-2) for each of my other ukuleles. The included strap is lightweight and narrow, but it works. The extra strings are nice. I see the kit now comes with flat plastic picks; you won't need those -- ukuleles are generally played with the fingers, or rarely with a felt pick.After buying it, I noticed it was the top-rated concert-sized ukulele in the online The Wirecutter review of the best ukuleles for beginners. Of course, you won't mistake it for a $500 solid-wood ukulele, but it's an amazing value for the price, and you can take it anywhere without worry. I bought a hard case for it (the Musician's Gear concert ukulele case fits it like a glove) and packed it in my suitcase for a recent plane trip. It came through fine.Update: After playing it for about 5 months, I changed the strings to Aquila Super Nylgut. The sound became significantly louder, if not quite as sweet to my ear. 5 months later, I changed to Aquila Sugar strings. Now it is really bright and loud, with a lot of projection and sustain. For the first time, in a group of 20 strummers, I can always hear myself play. The Sugar strings settle in pretty fast, but be forewarned, they do squeak when you pluck them, rather like wound strings. This gets better with time but doesn't entirely go away. The string maker recommends using hand lotion on your hands to minimize the squeaking.Second Update: Today after a couple of months with the Aquila Sugar strings, I replaced them with Martin M600 flurocarbon strings, and I really like them. There was something about the sugars that sounded just a little odd, a little artificial. The Martins have a clear bell-like tone that is equally loud as the sugars but sounds more natural. Of course, string choice is a matter of personal preference, but I'm really happy with the Martins. Martin M600s are smaller in diameter than the sugars and less stretchy than some strings, so they may seem a bit harder to your fingertips at first, as flurocarbons generally do. But they give a brilliant, rich tone.Third Update: I liked the Martin strings, but I became frustrated by flaws in the intonation. Switched the strings again, and this time it's the fantastic. Fremont BlackLine Mediums are thin black fluorocarbon strings. They give it amazing clarity, volume, resonance and sustain, and the intonation is near perfect all the way up the neck. I was thinking of upgrading to a solid wood instrument to take my playing to the next level, but now I'm not sure I need to. It looks so sleek with it's ebony strings that I gave it an elegant new strap befitting the look.",donner,Tanager

I have a tenor ukulele (larger) and consider myself new to ukuleles, playing only a year or so.  But I have to say how impressed I am with the sound of the Donner.  It is rich and warm.  Fit and finish is beautifully done albeit somewhat plain.  It was totally out of tune after delivery, and it took a lot of turnings to get the strings close, but after a day of tuning and playing it seems to be staying in tune well.  The padded case is nice but just slightly undersized......but it does fit.  The zippers are short and you need to insert the bottom first.  The strap is only OK (but the installed strap pegs are perfect and a big plus).  The Donner tuner takes some getting used to.  It is versatile in that it includes guitar and other instruments, it gives sharps and flats indications and the screen turns green when you're in tune.  Very nice. The extra strings are a plus. Also adding new strings appears to be easier than normal as there are slotted string lines instead of just holes where you insert and tie and lock normal ukulele strings.  Bonus on that design.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2017",Soprano,"10 year guitar player - ""If you're looking for a good quality ukulele to start on, this product is for you!""","Wanted a cheap uke, could have got a Kala but I gave Donner a chance mostly because it came with a sweet gigbag. I must say as a 10 year guitar player, this ukulele is well put together. It plays great, holds a tune VERY well. I even left it in my car in the heat for a few hours *don't do this at home* to see if the any expansion and contraction of the wood would cause it to lose some tune. I found after, using the chromatic tuner THAT COMES INCLUDED showed it to be in near perfect tune. Best value ukulele in my opinion. I really enjoy playing it. Ask anyone I work know, my uke and I are attached at the hip. I've learned 10+ songs so far and it's been a month. This is a great instrument for any beginner or an advanced player. The strings are much more comfortable to play as opposed to the steel strings on a guitar. If you're looking for a good quality ukulele to start on, this product is for you!",donner,Amazon Customer

It is not a high-end instrument, but I didn't want one until I learned how to play well. The sound is actually very nice, and I've taken it camping, where I  encountered someone who knows a thing or two about ukuleles. He actually said he wanted to try my instrument and was very surprised at the sound, and felt like it was a top notch beginner instrument.

I love that it stays in tune for me,  and I am very happy with all the extras it came with.  UPDATE:  I haven't even been playing for half a year yet, but I am making great progress, and recently went to the music store to get a capo. I tried out all their concert ukuleles,  and there was not a single  beginning ukulele that sounds as good as this one. Some of the $200 ukuleles  didn't even have as nice of a tone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2017",Concert,I had struggled with spending more on a Tenor from a Hawaii brand but did not want to spend that much on something that I may no,This is my first Ukulele. I went with the DUC-1 model (concert size) because of information that I had gathered off of the internet. I had struggled with spending more on a Tenor from a Hawaii brand but did not want to spend that much on something that I may not enjoy doing. The Uke arrived from UPS with no damage. There was an outer box with paper surrounding the inner box that contained the Uke which was in it's gig bag. I found no damage or flaws in the Uke and the color was pleasant a little rosier in color than my solid mahogany Dulcimer. The Uke was naturally out of tune with the strings loose (interesting that part of the care card stated for long term storage to loosen strings to prevent warping). I tuned the Uke with the included tuner and also one I had on hand. So far I have tuned it about a half dozen times as the strings stretch. The sustain is good and the sound is pleasant. The only thing that I do not like is the balance. I will use a strap and the included strap fits well but when you let go of the Uke it goes neck down because of the weight. Donner did include a cord with the strap to tie one end at the neck. This will prevent the balance issue for me. Since I just inboxed and started playing this is not a long term review. I am very happy with my choice and hope to get many hours of play as I learn.,donner,R. Burgess

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2017",Concert,"""That is mahogany!"" - me to some plebe in the near future","I wanted to wait awhile to post this review, but I'm honestly too excited about it so I'm just gonna do it now. I am an ABSOLUTE beginner, I've never played a string instrument...or any instrument. With the exception of the recorder in the 4th grade along with the rest of America, the purpose of which will one day reveal itself, I'm sure.Anyway. I'm a musical-beginner, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but this ukulele seems great for someone at my skill level (- 5). It was easy to tune (I'm keeping the strings it came with for now, but I may switch them to the Aquila ones I purchased along with this ukulele once I find an easy-to-follow tutorial for replacing uke strings)..The sound is sweet and I've been plucking at it for about a week now. It does need to be tuned quite often, but I'm aware that this is true for all (most?) new ukes/strings and this will hopefully improve with time.The packaging was solid and all the advertised components were included. There was nothing wrong (either aesthetically or otherwise) with the ukulele itself and the finish on it is beautiful. I actually really loved the smell of it too, which is probably weird, but it just smells like fresh mahogany. A side benefit of this uke-choice is that a whole world of ""That is mahogany!"" jokes are now open to me.Speaking of side benefits, the extras that came with this uke are great - the bag is nice and padded, the tuner is easy enough for a noob like myself to use, and the strap has already proven itself to be useful.I'm glad I chose this ukulele and look forward to gaining even more hipster street cred with it in the future. :)",donner,Ashley C

Not so, thanks to my new Donner ukele!  After researching online, I opted for this low-priced model that came equipped with tuner and carrying case.  Thank god for that as, knowing nothing, I would never have ordered a tuner.  Without that little baby, my 'career' would have ended after the first frustrating 20 minutes.  With the tuner and a week of practice, I'm strum patterning and chording to beat the band.  (OK, sorry for the bad pun.)Honestly, after one week and some amazing websites, I'm confident and fairly competent on a range of songs, from the ever-expected Somewhere Over the Rainbow to Hallelujah to You're So Vain to Jolene to I'm Yours.  True to my research info, I spent more time tuning the uke than trying to learn anything the first two days.  Now, after a week, my uke stays in tune from day to day and I just have to check to make sure it's still ready to play.Now if only I could get my fingertips to callous as easily as the ukulele learned to stay in tune.......",donner,Cara Mia

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2017",Concert,"I'm a UKE NEWBIE, and this instrument is AWESOME!!!","I've been wanting a ukulele all winter. I'm a 67 year old lady who has played guitar for a few decades. Totally self-taught, and strictly a chord strummer. I'd put off ordering a ukulele, but a week ago, when I asked my daughter in law what I should get my soon-to-be granddaughter for her birthday, she said, ""She's been wanting a ukule for so long!""  So, I took the plunge, and last week I ordered TWO of these Donner Concert Ukeleles... one for my granddaughter and one for myself.My granddaughter has never had any formal training on musical instruments. A few years ago I taught her a couple of chords on the guitar but that's it. When I gave her the uke I had printed out the chords to a few popular songs I knew she liked and showed her the basics. 24 hours later she came up to my house and I was stunned at how well she was playing these songs! I, too, found it quite easy to learn to play the thing, although it took my brain a bit longer to ""re-learn"" how to play chords on the uke as they were totally different than the guitar. But she and I were playing duets!Our 37 year old daughter was visiting today. She wanted me to play a song on the uke. I did, and she wanted to try. She had piano lessons as a kid and nothing more. I showed her a few chords and within a half hour she was easily playing Vance Joy's ""Riptide."" She was so excited and wanted to get a uke of her own, so I ordered a THIRD one of these today.As for the uke... the case it came in is very nice. Comes with an extra set of nylon strings and also a digital uke tuner, which can also tune a guitar, banjo, bass, and a few other stringed instruments.The uke itself was the perfect size. I couldn't imagine trying to play the smaller soprano size, and I didn't want  bigger one since I have a bigger acoustic guitar.When first tuning the uke, you might find it easier to use a keyboard to make sure you're getting those loose nylon strings on the correct octave. If you don't have a keyboard, you can find videos on youtube that will help you tune it. After you get them in tune the first time, it becomes much easier using the digital tuner. When you first start playing you'll have to be retuning those strings every few minutes, to get the ""stretch"" out of them. I found that after two days of playing, the strings stayed in tune much better than the first day.I love the sound of it. It's nicely made and an all-round FUN little instrument to play!The only thing negative is a very minor one... the directions that come with the digital tuner are so small you'd need a jeweler's loop or good magnifying glass to read them. I had to put the sheet on my scanner and blow it up 150% and copy it so I could actually read the thing! Since I had no experience with a digital tuner, it was essential to read the directions. However, as stated earlier, you can get help with this at youtube if you're new to them.So now Grandma, daughter, and granddaughter are hooked on this ukulele. Looks like there'll be some fun times around the campfires this summer!",donner,weebiscuit

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2017",Concert,Great buy and good quality...everything you need,"Understand that I'm reviewing this from the perspective of a beginner ukulele player, but I love this ukulele package. I played guitar previously, so I do have a little experience with stringed instruments (although the uke is very different - in a good way). The ukulele itself is nicely made. The wood grain is beautiful, with a satiny finish. It has a lovely, mellow sound. I play with a felt pick, which I feel also enhances the tone. As other reviewers noted, you have to tune the ukulele a LOT at first. After a week, I'm only tuning the G and A strings a wee bit each time I use it. The tuner is very easy to use, just make sure you have it on the ""ukulele"" setting! I love that it's really small and unobtrusive. I just leave it attached at the head and fold it down after I've tuned. The strap is a nice add-on. I haven't used it yet, but probably will at some point. Finally, you get an extra set of strings. I know nothing about uke strings, so I can't tell you if they are good ones or not, but I know from playing guitar that it's always good to have an extra set of strings on hand. The bag is nicely padded, and everything fits great in the front zip pocket. It's got two straps so you can put it on backpack style.I looked at a lot of ukuleles, and this seemed to be the best value for a good quality instrument with a lot of accessories. I'm very happy with it, and having a blast learning to play such a happy instrument. There are a ton of tutorials and lessons on YouTube, and you can find a lot of songs that have been adapted to the ukulele. I've learned 5 chords, and I'm working on my first song (The Tide is High, as done by Blondie). So much fun! I highly recommend this uke package. Happy strumming!",donner,"Kimberly A,Top Contributor: Makeup"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2017",Soprano,Attractive ukulele with accessories,"I bought the 21"" version for my cat since it was not too much more expensive than a toy guitar. It is quite small. The ukulele is nicely finished and it comes with a case, strap, tuner, and extra strings. My cat will play any stringed instrument with his claws or teeth.He also plays an electric guitar and an old acoustic that I found by a dumpster. Those have metal strings so I worried about his dental health. The nylon strings and smaller size of this ukulele make it a perfect replacement. Ukulele tuning is also more melodious on the open strings so his music sounds better, like wind chimes.The tone of the ukulele is all right, considering the body is around the size of a cigar box. It will need to be tuned a little each time prior to playing, though the strings might relax later. The action of the strings is easy. Playing harmonics on such short strings is difficult. When I play, I finger-pick, but I think most ukuleles are played with a felt pick, which is not included. This is one way that Donner could improve the product.I'd recommend this ukulele to anyone who needed a little one.",donner,~swinton

The fit and finish are excellent, though some may not fully appreciate the satin type finish. It produces a nice tone and was loud for a small laminate instrument. I'm not a primary Uke player but from an instrument standpoint this seems like it would be a little workhorse. I had to lower the saddle a bit (1/8 inch) but I'm particular about my set up. The factory set up from the box was certainly playable. I think the biggest improvement that could be made would be better tuning machines, but at this price point they are sufficient and seem to hold tune well once the strings have settled in. I also like the strap buttons, being a mandolin and guitar player it just feels right to use a strap with a Uke, most that I've seen don't include strap buttons so that was a nice feature. Overall it's a five star Ukulele for a beginner to intermediate player.",donner,grass_junkie

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2016",Soprano,Affordable and surprisingly well built and playable,"I have been playing guitar for about 8 years, and I tent to always get very nice high end instruments since normally ""you get what you pay for"" applies for them. This is my first Ukelele and my children like to play around with instruments as well, so I decided to give this a shot since I didn’t want to pay a lot for something that the kids might be rough with. All I got to say is AMAZING!The look of it is simply super high end, tough it is not solid wood it looks just as if it was all mahogany. Beautifully built.SOUND: Very clear and nice resonance from the woods which plays very well with an acoustic guitar in terms of volume. It is little, but puts out a nice warm yet Ukulele like crisp highsSTRINGS: I have kept the ones that are on and they do match the additional ones that they sent out (which is really cool), again not a Ukulele pro, however the strings are holding up very well and after the first week of playing and stay in tune quite wellBODY: For this price, SUPERB! It is solid built and I can tell it will also take on some beating for a while. The neck is beautiful with a satin finish which makes nice to slide back and forth as you playTUNERS: These in combination with the strings that it comes with have worked super well to keep the instrument in tune for days at a time only minor adjustments every other day, and good to go.PLAYABILITY: Right out of the box this Ukulele feels very smooth around the fretboard, the frets are well polished and do not catch your fingers, the back of the neck allows for easy position change.BAG: Sturdy, extra pocket with zippers for any accessories you might want to carry (tuners, strings, pics, etc.), and it has two shoulder straps sot that you can wear it like a backpack. Nice!EXTRAS: in most cases the “bundles” are a combination of a few cheap items along with the main Item just to catch attention. Not the case here, the tuner (of the same brand as the guitar) works super well, and the plus is that it can be used for any string/vibration instrument. I haven’t used the extra set of strings, but if they are the same as the ones that came installed, I am in good shape. The strap as a really nice pattern and works very well, it can even be adjusted to fit a smaller child.If fits right in with our instrument collection.If you are looking for a starting instrument with an affordable price and that you can actually play. In my opinion that is it.p.s. I did not get this guitar for free from the manufactured (paid $55 for it), and I am not affiliated with Donner, just enjoy good music and nice instruments.",donner,

I brought it up to pitch and of course there is a lot of slippage of the nylon strings but that is to be expected, When it is in tune it sounds surprisingly well. Just like you would expect a good ukulele to sound. I am a professional jazz guitarist and I am well pleased with this instrument so far.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2016",Concert,#NAME?,"This little buddy was actually an impromptu purchase, and being vacationing in Hawaii and seeing this deal at $60 shipped, sealed it's fate to be shipped to me. This is a very reasonable set - although I don't know about ukes much, in 30 minutes I was playing 'Losing my Religion' which incidentally seems to be in the right key for the uke. Anyway, few tech details:- Gig bag is nice and well-padded, very reasonable and good-looking, good pocket;- Tuner is simple and does the job, however buzzes when clipped onto the uke, so I keep it off;- Body is actually mahogany, from what it seems, and not veneer, it's solid wood albeit very thin;- Nicely done rosette, and generally cleanly built, and good looking while rather simple;- Finish is satin, and I prefer it that way - Mahogany has large pores, and this wood has been prepped reasonably well;- Frets are not dressed at a pro level, but they don't catch skin as someone mentioned, I guess that varies; for me it would have been no biggie to polish the edges off if they were rough, but actually for me that works so far;- Actual natural cattle bone nut and saddle;- Easy-loading bridge, kudos...===================================Update: yeah... I did have to go in and file off and round up the edges on frets. Use good sticky polyamide tape to protect the wood, use very tough but somewhat flexible material for the sanding block (I used a good sized eraser) and about 500-grit paper. Worked for me.Now..  nice sound, actually :) I'll be playing this baby a lot!",donner,Guitar Tech

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2016",Concert,Lovin' this li'l ukulele!,"While there are a lot of ukuleles available in a wide variety of price ranges on Amazon, if you're looking for a fairly-decent entry-level instrument, this li'l guy is a pretty good value. It is very nicely constructed with smooth mahogany plywood (body) and smooth, nicely interfaced mahogany blocks (neck, neck base [where the neck joins the body] and tuning section), and rosewood fret board and bridge. The primary thing that sold me was this ukulele's consistent intonation as you move up the fret board. The sound is full-bodied and resonant for the instrument's size. The wood finish is not ""shiny"" per se (i.e., it's unvarnished / unlacquered), but it's nevertheless nice and smooth -- not rough to the touch at all. The curved sides have a nice iridescent quality; the wood pattern shifts as you turn the instrument in the light. Construction is qualitative all the way around - the right-angle-joined edges are all just as smooth as can be and all of the non-wood fittings are cleanly and smoothly joined. The strap pegs are a nice touch, the plastic tuning pegs are perfectly fine and the tuning gears are protected under clear plastic.The logo-embroidered large-front-pocketed bag is surprisingly substantive and the included tuner, strap and strings make the entire package quite a deal. (I did have an issue with the G string buzzing a bit on the 1st fret but settled the issue with the seller.) I keep this ukulele nearby and keep picking it up to play,practice and learn.",donner,Bob Hepburn

We considered a number of different ukuleles before selecting this one. The quality of the wood and manufacturing on this Donner is noticeable and impressive and, consequently, the sound is rich and warm. We chose the concert size because we're all novices and a broad and sturdy folk, so we needed a little more room. I think the sopranos are about 3"" smaller in length.The tuner lights up when you're right on the note. We noticed no sharp edges anywhere; everything really is quality craftsmanship. One other thing to note is that every component related to the pegs is metal and should, therefore, be more durable than the plastic ones we say on a lot of other ukes. We're extremely pleased with this uke and everything in this package and I would recommend to to friends without hesitation.",donner,Ms. Takes' confessions of regret

It came with professionally packaged accessories: a strap (design as pictured), extra strings, and a tuner -- all individually packaged in an understated eco-brown with logos. Mine even came with extra arm straps (not pictured, and without a package). The case is much nicer in person and even the brown outer packing was nice.

The uke was of decent quality and build, the strings are taking time to settle, but I expected after working through the standard stretch phase for new strings. The finish of the wood was slightly rougher than I expected, and definitely not as smooth as the Lanikai and Cordova ukes that I've owned. The included strap and tuner were a nice touch, but that was countered by the poor English in the product tags, which made me wary about the quality.I have one gripe about the tuning pegs - the description listed them as wood, but they are NOT. The tuning pegs are wood colored plastic with a visible seam. It would have been really cool if the pegs matched the description.
